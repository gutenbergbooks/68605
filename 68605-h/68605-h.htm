<p class="h2sub">IN THE ROOKERY BUILDING.</p>

<p>“Has Vance returned yet?” asked Jared Whitemore, a
stout, florid-complexioned man of sixty-five, opening the
door of his private office and glancing into the outside
room.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied Edgar Vyce, his bookkeeper and office
manager—a tall, saturnine-looking man, who had been in
his employ several years.</p>

<p>“Send him in as soon as he comes back.”</p>

<p>The bookkeeper nodded carelessly and resumed his writing.</p>

<p>“Miss Brown,” said Jared to his stenographer and typewriter,
a very pretty brown-eyed girl of seventeen, the only
other occupant of the room, whose desk stood close to one
of the windows overlooking La Salle Street.</p>

<p>She immediately left her machine and followed her employer
into the inner sanctum.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitemore was a well-known speculator, one of the
shrewdest and most successful operators on the Chicago
Board of Trade.</p>

<p>He owned some of the best business sites in the city, and
his ground rents brought him in many thousands a year.</p>

<p>Accounted a millionaire many times over, no one could
with any degree of certainty say exactly what he was worth.</p>

<p>His plainly furnished office was on an upper floor of the
Rookery Building.</p>

<p>He did business for nobody but himself. Jarboe, Willicutt
&amp; Co., whose offices were on the ground floor of the
Board of Trade Building, were his brokers.</p>

<p>The office clock chimed the hour of five as the bookkeeper,
with a frown, laid down his pen, rested his elbow on the
corner of his tall desk and glanced down into the busy
thoroughfare.</p>

<p>At that moment the office door opened and a messenger
boy entered.</p>

<p>Mr. Vyce came to the railing and received an envelope
addressed to himself.</p>

<p>He signed for it, tore it open, read the contents, which
were brief, with a corrugated brow, and then, with much
deliberation, tore the paper into fine particles and tossed
them into the waste-basket.</p>

<p>For a moment or two he paced up and down before his
desk, with his hands thrust into his trousers pockets, and
then resumed his work just as the door opened again and
admitted a stalwart, good-looking lad, with a frank, alert
countenance and a breezy manner, who entered briskly with
a handful of pamphlets and papers.</p>

<p>“Mr. Whitemore wants you to report in his office at once,
Thornton,” said the bookkeeper, in a surly kind of voice,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
accompanied with a look which plainly showed that he
was not particularly well disposed toward the boy.</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Vance, cheerily, turning toward
the private office, on the door of which he knocked, and
then entered on being told to come in.</p>

<p>“I hate him!” muttered Mr. Vyce, following the boy’s
retreating figure with a dark scowl. “He’s a thorn in my
path. He’s altogether too thick with Whitemore. I can’t
understand what the old man sees in him. For the last
three months I’ve noticed that my hold here is slipping
away, and just when I need it the most. Just when things
were coming my way, too. Now, with a fortune in sight,
this boy is crowding me to the wall. Curse him! I can’t
understand what it means. Is it possible Whitemore suspects
me? Pshaw! Am I not an old and trusted employee?
I’ve always been in his confidence to a large extent,
but of late he has been keeping things from me—matters
I ought to know—especially in reference to this
deal he has on. Those corn options are on the point of
expiring, and I expected ere this to have been sent West
to settle with the elevator people and get the receipts, for
corn is on the rise and the old man is ahead at this stage
of the game. I strongly suspect he means to corner the
market this time. He’s got the dust to attempt it with,
and already he holds options on nearly half of the visible
supply in Kansas and Nebraska, besides what he has stored
here. There is no telling what he has been doing during
the last thirty days, as not a word about corn has passed
between us during that time. It’s not like Whitemore to
act this way with me. Something is up, and by George!
I’ll find out what it is.”</p>

<p>Mr. Vyce drove his pen savagely into a little glass receptacle
filled with small shot and turned to the window again,
after glancing at the clock.</p>

<p>Bessie Brown came out of the inner office with her notebook
in her hand and sat down at her machine to transcribe
her notes.</p>

<p>In a few moments Mr. Vyce came over to her desk and,
taking up his station where he could catch a glance of what
she was writing, remarked:</p>

<p>“Are you working overtime to-night, Miss Brown?”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Mr. Vyce,” she said, covering the paper
with her hands, “this is strictly confidential.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said, between his teeth, altering
his position. “But you haven’t answered my question.”</p>

<p>“I expect to be busy until six,” she replied, without
looking at him.</p>

<p>“I have tickets for McVickar’s,” he continued. “Would
you honor me with your company there this evening? It is
not necessary that you return home to dress. We can dine
at Palmer’s.”</p>

<p>“You must excuse me,” she replied, with a heightened
color, “but I never go anywhere without my mother’s knowledge
and permission.”</p>

<p>“But you went to the Auditorium two weeks ago with
Thornton,” he said, in a tone of chagrin.</p>

<p>“Mr. Thornton asked mamma if I could go, and she
consented.”</p>

<p>“You never invited me to call at your home, so I could
become acquainted with your mother,” persisted Mr. Vyce,
who was evidently jealous of the intimacy which existed
between Vance and the young lady.</p>

<p>Bessie said nothing to this, but applied herself more attentively
to her work.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to extend that privilege to me, Miss
Brown?” he continued, fondling his heavy black mustache.</p>

<p>“Mr. Vyce, I am very busy just now,” she replied, with
some embarrassment.</p>

<p>The bookkeeper gave her a savage glance and then walked
away without another word.</p>

<p>Much to her relief, he soon put on his hat and left the
office abruptly, shutting the door with a slam.</p>

<p>At the same moment Vance came out of the private office
and stepped up beside the pretty typewriter.</p>

<p>She looked up with a smile and did not offer to hide
from his gaze the long typewritten letter on which she was
engaged.</p>

<p>Evidently there was nothing there Vance ought not to
know.</p>

<p>“Will you please turn on the light, Vance?” she asked,
sweetly, her fingers never leaving the keys for a moment.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Bessie,” he replied, with alacrity, raising his
hand to the shaded electric bulb above her machine and
turning the key, whereupon the slender wires burst into a
white glow. “How much more have you to do?”</p>

<p>“Another page, almost,” she answered, with another quick
glance into his bright, eager young face.</p>

<p>“I won’t be able to see you to the car to-night,” he said,
regretfully.</p>

<p>That was a pleasure the young man had for some time appropriated
to himself and Bessie as willingly accorded.</p>

<p>“You are going to stay downtown, then, for a while?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; I shall be here for an hour yet, perhaps. After
supper I’ve got to meet Mr. Whitemore in his rooms at the
Grand Pacific. I’ve got to notify mother of the fact by
telephone.”</p>

<p>Vance went over to the booth in the corner of the office
and rang up a drug store in the vicinity of his home, on
the North Side.</p>

<p>Outside the shades of night were beginning to fall.</p>

<p>From the windows of the office one could see directly
up La Salle Street.</p>

<p>The cars, as they made the turn into or out of the street
at the corner of Monroe, flashed their momentary glares
of red and green lights, and filled the air continually with
the jangle of their bells.</p>

<p>The sidewalks were filled with a dense crowd that poured
out continually from the street entrances of the office buildings.</p>

<p>They streamed out of the brokers’ offices and commission
houses on either side of La Salle Street, and the tide set
toward the upper end of the thoroughfare, where stood the
girders and cables of the La Salle Street bridge.</p>

<p>Vance took all this in with a brief survey from the window,
after he had sent his message across the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>“What do you think?” said Bessie, as he paused once
more beside her. “Mr. Vyce asked me to go to the theatre
with him to-night. Hasn’t he a cheek?”</p>

<p>“Of course you accepted?” said Vance with a grin.</p>

<p>“Of course I did no such thing,” she answered, pausing
for an instant in her work, as she looked up with an indignant
flush on her creamy cheeks. “You know better than
that, Vance. You just want to provoke me,” with a charming
pout.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” he answered, with a quiet chuckle, “but
you mustn’t mind me.”</p>

<p>She smiled her forgiveness and went on with her work.</p>

<p>“There, that’s done,” she said, in a few moments, pushing
back her chair. “I hope I haven’t made any mistakes,”
as she rose to take the sheets into the inner office.</p>

<p>“No fear of that, I guess,” said the boy, encouragingly.
“You’re about as accurate as they come, Bessie.”</p>

<p>She paused on the threshold of the door to flash him
back a look of appreciation for the compliment and then
disappeared within.</p>

<p>Presently she returned and started to put on her things.</p>

<p>“It looks a little bit like rain, doesn’t it?” she asked,
glancing at the darkened sky, where not a star was visible.</p>

<p>“You can have my umbrella, if you wish,” Vance offered,
“but I guess it won’t rain yet awhile.”</p>

<p>“Never mind; I’ll chance it. Good night, Vance.”</p>

<p>“Good night, Bessie,” and the outside door closed behind
her.</p>

<p>Vance returned to his desk and proceeded to make copious
extracts from a pile of pamphlets and reports he had taken
from a closet.</p>

<p>In half an hour Mr. Whitemore came out of his sanctum
with his hat on.</p>

<p>“You’d better go to supper now, Vance. Meet me
promptly at eight o’clock at my rooms,” he said, “and
bring everything with you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Whitemore left, and the lad, making a bundle of his
notes and such papers as he knew were wanted by his employer,
turned out the electric lights and locked up the
office.</p>

<p>He didn’t know it then, but this was the last time for
many days he was to see the inside of the Rookery Building.</p>

<p>Nor did he dream of the tragedy that awaited his return
to the office.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">BOUND WEST.</p>

<p>Vance went to a Clark Street restaurant and had supper.</p>

<p>It was all right, but the boy did not enjoy it as much as
he would have done at home.</p>

<p>The Thorntons lived in a small house, one of a row, on
the North Side, which Mrs. Thornton owned.</p>

<p>They had once been wealthy, for Mr. Thornton had at
one time been a successful member of the Chicago Board
of Trade.</p>

<p>But a few months before his death, which had occurred
ten years previously, he had been caught in a short deal
and squeezed.</p>

<p>He extricated himself at the cost of his entire fortune.</p>

<p>Everything was swept away except the one little house,
the property of Mrs. Thornton, to which the family immediately
moved, and a few thousand dollars banked in the
wife’s name.</p>

<p>After Mr. Thornton’s death the widow devoted herself
to her children, and when Vance graduated from the public
school, she made application to Mr. Whitemore, with whom
her husband had had business relations, for a position for
her son in his office.</p>

<p>The application being made at a lucky moment, the lad
was taken on, and had in every way proved himself worthy
of Jared Whitemore’s confidence.</p>

<p>Promptly at eight o’clock Vance was shown up to Mr.
Whitemore’s rooms in the Grand Pacific Hotel.</p>

<p>The corn operator was in his sitting-room before a table
that was scattered over with papers and telegraph blanks.</p>

<p>It was a cool evening, but Jared Whitemore was in his
shirt sleeves, and, although the windows were down at the
top, his face was red and he was perspiring furiously.</p>

<p>A half-smoked cigar projected between his lips, and several
discarded stumps lay on a lacquer tray that held one
of the hotel pitchers of ice water.</p>

<p>“You have the government report on the visible supply
in that bundle, have you?” asked Jared Whitemore, as soon
as he became aware of the boy’s presence in the room.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Let me have it,” with an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>Vance had it before his employer in a twinkling.</p>

<p>“Your notes, please,” said the operator, after he had
studied the report for several minutes.</p>

<p>The boy laid them before him.</p>

<p>“Put the pamphlets down there. Now, take the evening
paper and go over there by the window and sit down.”</p>

<p>Vance did so, and there was perfect silence in the room
for the next half hour, when it was broken by a knock on
the door.</p>

<p>“See who that is,” almost snapped Whitemore, jerking
his thumb in the direction of the entrance.</p>

<p>Vance found a telegraph boy outside, signed for the yellow
envelope and brought it to his employer.</p>

<p>Two more dispatches arrived before the little marble
clock on the mantel chimed the hour of nine.</p>

<p>Another half hour of almost perfect silence ensued, during
which two more cigar stumps were added to the collection
on the dish; and Vance was beginning to wonder why
he was being held there by Mr. Whitemore, when the operator
rose from his seat, mopped his forehead with his familiar
bandana handkerchief and then sat down again.</p>

<p>“Vance.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered the boy, springing up.</p>

<p>“Come here.”</p>

<p>The tones were short, sharp and incisive.</p>

<p>“Sit down here alongside of me.”</p>

<p>Vance obeyed this order with military promptness.</p>

<p>“When can you start for Omaha?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>“Sir!” said the boy, almost speechless from amazement.</p>

<p>“I asked you when you could leave for Omaha?” repeated
the operator, brusquely.</p>

<p>“By the eight o’clock train in the morning, if you particularly
wish it,” answered the astonished lad.</p>

<p>“Very well; make your arrangements to that effect. Now,
Vance, I want to speak to you. Heretofore I have always
closed my dealings with the elevator people through Mr.
Vyce. For reasons which I need not discuss with you I am
going to send you to do the business for me this time.”</p>

<p>The boy’s eyes expanded to the size of saucers at this
information.</p>

<p>It simply meant a most remarkable expression of confidence
on Mr. Whitemore’s part in his youthful office assistant.</p>

<p>Confidence not only in the boy’s business sagacity, but
even more so in his integrity, for he would be obliged to
handle checks signed in blank for a very large sum of
money; just how large would, of course, depend on the
amount of corn the options covered.</p>

<p>That it ran into several millions of bushels the lad already
knew.</p>

<p>“I am taking this unusual course,” continued Mr. Whitemore,
lighting a fresh cigar and regarding Vance keenly,
“for several reasons. To begin with, since I started this
deal I have in hand I have met with opposition from a most
unexpected quarter. It could only have developed through
information furnished by some one who had an insight to
my plans. In order to test the accuracy of my suspicions
in a certain direction I cut off all information from that
quarter. The result has been confusion in the ranks of the
opposition. I’m, therefore, convinced I can at any time
put my finger on the traitor to my interests. To continue
the further development of my scheme, I have decided to
substitute you for Mr. Vyce, so far as the settlement of my
Western corn options are concerned. During the last five
or six weeks you have probably noticed that I have employed
you on business of a confidential nature. This was
to test you for the purpose I had in view. On one occasion
I so arranged matters that you were forced to retain in
your possession over Sunday a very large sum of money.
I had no doubts as to your honesty, but I wished to see how
you would proceed under the responsibility. The result
was perfectly satisfactory to me. Vance, I knew your
father well. We had many business dealings, and I found
him a man on whom I could implicitly rely. I believe you
are his duplicate.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Vance, gratefully, as Mr. Whitemore
paused for a moment.</p>

<p>“Now to business. Here is a power of attorney, which
will give you all the necessary authority to represent me
on this Western trip. Here are your general instructions,”
and he handed Vance the two typewritten pages Bessie
Brown had executed just before she left the office for the
night.</p>

<p>“You will go to Omaha first, thence to Kansas City, and
so on. Here are letters of introduction addressed to the
elevator firms. Some of them are personally acquainted
with me. These are the vouchers for the options. You will
insist on all settlements at the figures given in the options,
which, as you will see, are below the market quotations.
Now, as to the payments of the balances, here is a small
check-book of the Chicago National Bank. I have made
out and signed sixteen checks in blank, one of each payable
to the order of the elevator firm; all you will have to do
is to fill in the amount after the difference has been computed.
Immediately after each settlement you will mail
me by registered letter, care of the Chicago National Bank,
the firm’s receipt for the amount of money represented by
the check, together with the warehouse receipt. Now, read
your instructions over carefully, and if there is anything
you have to suggest, I will listen to you.”</p>

<p>Vance went over the two-page letter and found that it
covered every emergency, so far as he could see.</p>

<p>The boy was especially directed to visit certain out-of-the-way
places, where elevators, reported as disused or
empty, were known to exist, and to ascertain by every artifice
in his power whether any corn had been received there
for storage during the past three months. This was one
of the most important objects of his journey.</p>

<p>“Here are a couple of hundred dollars to cover incidental
expenses,” said Mr. Whitemore, handing Vance a roll of
bills. “I hardly need to tell you that I am reposing an
almost unlimited confidence in your honor and business
sagacity—a somewhat unusual thing to do with one so
young as you. But I am rarely mistaken in my estimate
of character, and I feel satisfied you will fill the bill to the
letter. I may say right here that you have studied the corn
market to advantage. Such details as I have asked you to
look into for me you have gone over and reduced to practical
results with astonishing clearness and dispatch for
one of your years and limited experience with Board of
Trade methods. You seem to be a born speculator, like
your father. I have long wished to associate with me a
young man of nerve and accurate foresight in whom I
could thoroughly depend. You appear to combine all the
qualities in question. On this trip you are bound to acquire
knowledge of the most confidential nature—information
that could not but seriously embarrass me if it became
known to my business opponents. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Vance, with a serious face.</p>

<p>“You see how much I depend on your loyalty?”</p>

<p>“You need have no fear but I will fulfil your trust down
to the smallest degree,” answered Vance, earnestly.</p>

<p>“I am sure of it, Vance. The proof of the pudding is
that I am sending you West on this business. One thing
your age, and, I hope, your wit and cautiousness, are particularly
adapted to, and that is acquiring the information
about the possible contents of those elevators reported
to be empty. On the thoroughness of your report as regards
these properties will depend one of my most important
moves on the corn market.”</p>

<p>“I will find out the truth, if that be within the bounds
of possibility.”</p>

<p>“Now, Vance, another thing. Your mother will naturally
want to know where you are going, but it will be

necessary for you to withhold that information, for I have
an idea that as soon as your absence is noted at the office
she will be approached on the subject by some one interested
in tracing your movements. You will simply tell her you
are going out of town on business for me and will be back
in a few days. Do not write to any one in Chicago, not
even your folks, while you are away. Do you understand
me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Should you find it necessary to communicate with me
at any time, call up Mr. Walcott, of the Chicago National
Bank, on the long-distance telephone, and he will send
for me.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p>“I believe there is nothing further, so I will say good
bye till I see you at the office after your return.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, sir.”</p>

<p>Vance took up his hat, after carefully putting all the
papers and the check-book of the Chicago National Bank
in an inside pocket of his coat, and left the hotel.</p>

<p>When he reached home an hour later he duly astonished
his mother and sister with the information that he
was going out of town on business for his employer.</p>

<p>Of course the first thing they wanted to know was his
destination.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, mother, I can’t tell you. Where I am
going, as well as the object of the trip, is a business
secret.”</p>

<p>“But we ought to know, Vance,” expostulated his pretty
sister Elsie. “Unless you tell us we shall be worried to
death about you.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, sis,” he replied, taking her face in his two
hands and kissing her cherry-red, pouting lips; “but I
am under strict orders not to say a word about it.”</p>

<p>“It’s real mean of you. You know neither mamma nor
I would say a word if you told us not to,” she persisted,
throwing her arms about his neck coaxingly.</p>

<p>“Don’t blame me, Elsie—blame the boss. Let me tell
you one thing, dear. I feel sure this trip is the chance
of my life. Mr. Whitemore as good as said so.”</p>

<p>And with that the gentle mother and loving sister had
to be content.</p>

<p>Next morning Vance boarded a Pullman drawing-room
car and left Chicago over the C. B. &amp; Q. railroad for
Omaha.</p>

<p class="h2sub">TAKING UP THE OPTIONS.</p>

<p>Vance arrived at Omaha on the following morning and
registered at the Great Western Hotel, where he had
breakfast.</p>

<p>Then he went to the reading-room and looked over the
papers, particularly noting the corn situation.</p>

<p>It was now time for him to be about his business.</p>

<p>He procured a large, oblong manilla envelope, in which
he enclosed his letter of instruction, all but one of his
letters of introduction, option vouchers and his check-book,
and after removing a single specific check marked by
a perforated capital “A,” he sealed up the package,
addressed it to himself and deposited it in the hotel safe.</p>

<p>Then he sallied forth on the streets of Omaha.</p>

<p>The hotel clerk had directed him where to find the
elevator buildings, which were located at various points
along the river front.</p>

<p>He took a car to the nearest point and then inquired
his way to the office of Flint, Peabody &amp; Co., who controlled
three of the elevators.</p>

<p>Their counting-room was in Elevator A.</p>

<p>“I should like to see Mr. Peabody,” he said to a clerk
who asked him his business.</p>

<p>“He is busy at present. Take a seat.”</p>

<p>After waiting half an hour he was shown into the
private office.</p>

<p>“Mr. Peabody?” asked Vance of a little, white-haired
old gentleman seated at a mahogany desk alongside a
window overlooking the Missouri river.</p>

<p>“Yes; what can I do for you?”</p>

<p>Vance handed him his card, in one corner of which was
printed Jared Whitemore in small type.</p>

<p>“Mr. Thornton, eh?” exclaimed the busy head of the
establishment, regarding him with some surprise as he
sized him up from head to foot.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been expecting a representative of Mr. Whitemore,
as those corn options expire at noon to-day. I am
bound to say I looked for an older person than you. I
presume you have a power of attorney to act for him?”
said Mr. Peabody, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>Vance produced the paper, which the gentleman very
carefully examined.</p>

<p>“How am I to know that you are really the person set
forth in this document—that you are actually Mr. Whitemore’s
representative? It may be a forgery, and you may
be acting for people opposed to that gentleman’s interests,”
said Mr. Peabody sharply.</p>

<p>“I have a letter of introduction which ought to cover
that point,” answered Vance, promptly producing an envelope
addressed to the person he was talking to.</p>

<p>“Hum!” said Mr. Peabody, glancing it over. “Seems
to be all right. However, as his option is a large one
covering grain in our three elevators, I’ve got to be careful.
Excuse me a moment.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to call up Mr. Whitemore?” asked
Vance as the gentleman rose from his desk.</p>

<p>“Why do you ask?” asked Mr. Peabody abruptly, casting
a suspicious look at the boy.</p>

<p>“Because, for business reasons he expressly desires that
you should call up Mr. Walcott of the Chicago National
Bank and ask for him. He does not want any communication
at his office direct.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied the gentleman, who easily surmised
Mr. Whitemore’s reasons.</p>

<p>The elevator magnate entered a telephone booth at the
end of the room and sat there a matter of fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>“I am satisfied that you are Mr. Whitemore’s representative,”
he said as he reseated himself at his desk.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
“Now, young man, we will talk business. Of course you
don’t expect me to close with you except at the market
price?”</p>

<p>“I expect to settle with you at the price named in the
option, less the amount paid to secure it,” said Vance
promptly.</p>

<p>“You ought to know that corn is several points above
the figure stated in the option. We cannot close on those
terms.”</p>

<p>“Do I understand that you refuse to make a settlement
of this transaction according to the terms of the
option?” asked Vance, rising to his feet.</p>

<p>“Sit down, young man,” said the elevator magnate. “You
have the voucher for the option with you, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“I should like to see it.”</p>

<p>“You are prepared to redeem the option now, are you?”
and Mr. Peabody glanced at the clock, which indicated
close on to the noon hour.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>The gentleman considered the matter for several minutes,
during which he cast penetrating looks at Vance’s
clear-cut, determined face.</p>

<p>“Does Mr. Whitemore propose to hold this corn in
storage here?”</p>

<p>“I have no instructions as to its immediate removal,”
replied Vance; “that is all I can say.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Have you Mr. Whitemore’s check for the
difference?”</p>

<p>“I have Mr. Whitemore’s signed check, made out to
your order, which I will hand you as soon as the amount
has been computed.”</p>

<p>“It is possible there will be a difference in our figures,”
said Mr. Peabody, with a grim smile.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied Vance, briskly. “The amount
has been left to me to fill in.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” exclaimed Mr. Peabody, in a tone of surprise.</p>

<p>Vance repeated his remark.</p>

<p>“By George, young man, he seems to place implicit
confidence in you!” and the head of the elevator firm once
more looked Vance over, and with some curiosity.</p>

<p>Mr. Peabody, having decided to close up the transaction
on the terms of the option, which he was legally bound
to do, since Vance could not be bluffed into accepting
less favorable ones, the differences were calculated, and
the boy filled in the check designated as “A,” requesting
a receipt for the amount, which was immediately made
out and handed to him.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitemore thus became the owner of something
over a million bushels of corn stored in elevators A, B,
and C.</p>

<p>This completed Vance’s business in Omaha.</p>

<p>On his way back to the hotel he stopped at the postoffice,
and forwarded to his employer, in care of the Chicago
National Bank, the receipt for the money covered by
the check.</p>

<p>Then he went to dinner, after which he spent an hour
viewing some of the sights of the western city.</p>

<p>At four o’clock he took a cab for the Union Depot, bought
a ticket for Kansas City, and took his seat in a Pullman
sleeper.</p>

<p>He arrived at his destination about midnight, drove
to one of the principal hotels and went to bed, after taking
the precaution to deposit his valuable papers in the
office safe.</p>

<p>There were three different elevator firms he had to visit
in this city.</p>

<p>He presented himself at the first at ten o’clock.</p>

<p>Here his youth was also unfavorably commented on in
a transaction which involved 600,000 bushels of grain,
and the head of the firm was inclined to hold off, until
Vance insisted that he should communicate with his employer
in Chicago.</p>

<p>Not being able to get Mr. Walcott on the long-distance
’phone, Vance suggested that he call up Flint,
Peabody &amp; Co., of Omaha.</p>

<p>The gentleman, after some demur, consented to do this,
being personally acquainted with Mr. Peabody, and the
result of the confab was so satisfactory that Vance completed
his business with him, getting a call on the corn,
as the option did not expire until the next day.</p>

<p>At the offices of the other two elevators Vance had
very little trouble, his power of attorney and letters of
introduction being accepted without question, and no attempt
being made to evade the terms of the option.</p>

<p>“That winds up this town,” he said in a tone of satisfaction
as he left the last place. “It is easier than I
expected. Now for the postoffice.”</p>

<p>He inquired the way there, purchased a stamped envelope,
and sent off the three receipts by registered mail,
according to his instructions.</p>

<p>“I’ve got lots of time now, as the next option at Grainville
does not expire until Friday,” he reflected as he took
a car for his hotel. “Guess I’ll take in a show to-night.”</p>

<p>He reached the hotel in time for lunch.</p>

<p>While he was in the dining-room a smart, dapper-looking
young man entered the hotel rotunda and walked briskly
up to the office counter.</p>

<p>Taking possession of the registry book, he glanced rapidly
over the day’s arrivals.</p>

<p>His nervous finger-tips paused for an instant at Vance
Thornton’s name, which, in clear handwriting, stood almost
at the top of the first page.</p>

<p>The young man noted the number of the room to which
the boy had been assigned, and then glanced sharply at
the numbered pigeon-holes where the room keys were
deposited.</p>

<p>“He’s here, all right,” he muttered, as he turned away
with a singular smile, “and is not in his room. He
reached here early this morning, as his name is right under
the date. He ought to be an easy proposition for Sadie
to work. I must have those corn options and whatever
warehouse receipts he has secured. Old Whitemore was
pretty slick to send this young chap instead of Vyce,
whom we depended on. But the old fox is up against a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
crowd as slick as himself this time, and he’s going to be
squeezed good and hard.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking to himself, the dapper young man pulled
a cigar from his pocket, bit off the end, and lit it.</p>

<p>Then he walked over and seated himself in a chair that
commanded a view of the office.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">MR. GUY DUDLEY.</p>

<p>The dapper young man had almost finished his cigar
when Vance came into the rotunda from the dining-room.</p>

<p>The stranger recognized the boy at once, which was not
at all surprising, since he had met Vance probably fifty
times in Chicago in the course of business.</p>

<p>“Why, hello, Thornton!” he exclaimed, walking briskly
up to the lad and extending his hand in a cordial manner;
“this is a surprise. What brings you out west, eh?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Dudley!” ejaculated Vance, somewhat taken back
by the encounter.</p>

<p>The circumstance annoyed him greatly.</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” said the dapper gentleman, whose age might
have been twenty-three. “Why the handle? I’m Guy to
my friends, don’t you know! Aren’t you going to shake?”</p>

<p>Common politeness compelled Vance to accept the young
man’s hand, though it was with some reluctance.</p>

<p>“You’re about the last chap I’d have thought of meeting
out here in Kansas, ‘pon my word,” continued Dudley,
volubly. “But I’m deuced glad to see you, all the same.”</p>

<p>The reverse was the case with Vance, though of course
he did not so express himself.</p>

<p>He was inclined to regard the meeting as unfortunate.</p>

<p>“I had no idea of seeing you here, either,” said Vance,
with no great enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“I s’pose not,” said Dudley, showing his fine set of
teeth with a sort of feline smile. “It’s always the unexpected
what happens, don’t you know. Have a smoke?”
and he offered Vance a cigar.</p>

<p>“Thank you, I don’t smoke.”</p>

<p>“Come over to the Criterion, then, and I’ll blow you
off,” and Dudley grabbed him by the arm in a friendly
way.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to excuse me. I do not drink,” replied
Vance firmly.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it, do you?” said Dudley, clearly disappointed.
“A fellow can’t drink alone, don’t you know?
Take a soda or a sarsaparilla—anything, just to seem
social.”</p>

<p>The dapper young man did not appear inclined to be
easily shaken off.</p>

<p>Vance hesitated, and Dudley, taking advantage of his
momentary indecision, pressed him so strongly that the
boy, not wishing to appear rude, agreed to accompany his
undesirable acquaintance across the street to the swell
establishment known as the Criterion.</p>

<p>“I’ve only just come to town,” said Guy Dudley as they
ranged up alongside the mahogany bar, rather an unusual
experience for Vance, who never frequented such places
in Chicago. “You see, the governor, my father, you know,
has a big interest in one of the flour mills out here, and
as he couldn’t come himself, he sent me to look after a
matter of importance which affects his control of the
business.”</p>

<p>Vance nodded politely.</p>

<p>“I s’pose you’re here on business connected with your
boss, Whitemore, eh?”</p>

<p>The speaker’s sharp eyes glinted curiously.</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?” asked Vance cautiously.</p>

<p>“Why, what else should bring you to Kansas City?”</p>

<p>“There might be several reasons other than what you
suggested,” said Vance, sparring for a valid excuse to
throw Guy Dudley off the track. “My father had business
interests here before he died which were never settled.”</p>

<p>This was strictly a fact; though Vance knew very well
that the matter at which he hinted was not in the slightest
danger of ever being settled in his mother’s favor at that
late day.</p>

<p>“You don’t say,” replied Dudley, an incredulous smile
curling his lips.</p>

<p>“As to Mr. Whitemore,” added Vance, “my experience
in his employ is that he is not accustomed to send a boy
like me to execute important business.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” winked Dudley, putting down the glass
he had just drained; “but then one can never tell just
what Whitemore may do. He’s as shrewd as they make
them nowadays.”</p>

<p>To this remark Vance made no answer.</p>

<p>“How long are you going to stay in town?” said Guy
Dudley, changing the subject.</p>

<p>“I may leave to-morrow and I may not,” replied his
companion evasively.</p>

<p>“A short stay, eh? Well, you ought to make it a merry
one. What are you going to do with yourself to-night?”</p>

<p>“I think I shall go to the theater,” said Vance carelessly.</p>

<p>“Just what I was going to propose,” said Dudley, with
suppressed eagerness. “You must come with me. There
is a good show at Hyde &amp; Beaman’s. S’pose we go
there?”</p>

<p>Vance was rather taken aback at this proposition.</p>

<p>He was not a bit anxious to go with Guy Dudley under
the circumstances.</p>

<p>But to refuse his invitation without some good reason
was sure to give offence, and Vance always considered it
a wise policy not to make an enemy if he could avoid
doing so.</p>

<p>So he accepted Dudley’s offer, much to the young man’s
inward satisfaction, and then pleaded a business engagement
to get rid of him.</p>

<p>The dapper young man, having accomplished all that
he wanted for the present, made no further effort to press
his society on Vance, hinting that he also had business to
attend to; as indeed he had, but not of the nature he would
have his boy acquaintance believe.</p>

<p>So they parted at the entrance to the Criterion, Dudley
promising to call for him at his hotel at about half-past
seven that evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>Kansas City, Kansas, is a wideawake, lively town, and
Vance Thornton spent several hours that afternoon wandering
about the principal streets, an interested observer
of western progress.</p>

<p>Promptly at seven-thirty Guy Dudley presented himself
at the hotel office and inquired for Vance Thornton.</p>

<p>“Are you Mr. Dudley?” asked the clerk.</p>

<p>“That’s my name,” said the dapper young man airily.</p>

<p>“You will find Mr. Thornton in the reading-room.”</p>

<p>“Well, old man,” said Dudley, tapping Vance on the
shoulder, where he sat looking over the copy of a current
magazine, “I see you’re all ready and waiting. Just put
on your coat and we’ll trot along.”</p>

<p>Vance donned his light overcoat and the pair left the
hotel together.</p>

<p>“I s’pose you won’t indulge even to the extent of a
cigarette?” said Dudley, pulling out a silver case and
tendering it to the lad. “No? All right; bad practice,
I know, but it’s one of my follies,” he said lightly as he
lit a match and applied a light to a gold-rimmed cylinder
of Turkish tobacco. “When one has a quantity of wild
oats to sow the quicker he puts ’em under the ground the
better,” he added with a laugh.</p>

<p>“You appear to be one of the boys,” said Vance, for
want of something better to say.</p>

<p>“Yes, I make it a point to see my share of life occasionally,”
the dapper young man admitted with a grin. “You
don’t go around much, do you?” with a slight sneer.</p>

<p>“No,” said Vance with a shake of his head. “One needs
to keep his wits clear in our line, and I don’t see how
that can be done if you stay up three-quarters of the night
chasing the elephant.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! When a fellow wakes up in the morning feeling
a bit rocky a dose of bromo-seltzer will fetch him
around all right. All work and no play makes Jack a
dull boy. If I didn’t take a run out of a night with the
boys once in awhile I wouldn’t be worth shucks. You
don’t know what you lose, old chap. Still, you’re young
yet.”</p>

<p>“I believe in enjoying myself in a rational manner,
Mr. Dudley,” said Vance. “Drinking and smoking and
billiards and card-playing don’t quite fall in with my idea
of a good time.”</p>

<p>“All right,” remarked Dudley carelessly; “every one
to his taste. Well, here we are,” and he turned in at
the entrance to Hyde &amp; Beaman’s theater, followed by
Vance.</p>

<p>Dudley had secured good seats in the orchestra, and as
the performance was above the average Vance thoroughly
enjoyed it.</p>

<p>“You don’t object to having a bite, do you?” asked Guy
Dudley after the show.</p>

<p>“I don’t usually eat late at night,” replied Vance, “but
I have no objection to joining you. Where will we go?”</p>

<p>“There’s a famous English chop-house on Blank street,”
said the dapper young man, with a glint of satisfaction
in his eyes; “we’ll take a cab and go there.”</p>

<p>“Why wouldn’t the place over the way do as well?”
asked the boy. “It looks to be a first-class restaurant.”</p>

<p>“So it is, but it isn’t on a par with Bagley’s. They
have a fine grill-room there, and though the bill of fare
is limited, it’s English from A to Z. I guess you’ve never
been in one of those establishments.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I have,” admitted the boy.</p>

<p>“Then it will be my pleasure to introduce you to something
worth while. Hi, there!” beckoning to a cab driver
who sat muffled up on his box.</p>

<p>“Get in,” to Vance as the jehu sprang down and opened
the cab door, and the boy allowed the accomplished Mr.
Dudley to push him into the vehicle. “Bagley’s on Blank
street,” said the dapper young man to the driver, and a
moment later they were on their way to that notorious
Kansas City resort.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the cab drew up before the entrance
to Bagley’s, a dingy looking building situated in a
narrow alley off one of the business thoroughfares.</p>

<p>Vance had expected to see a brilliantly lighted establishment,
with big plate glass windows and every sign of
a high-toned restaurant.</p>

<p>The contrary was the case.</p>

<p>Not even a sign distinguished Bagley’s place from that
of the other buildings in the vicinity, though a red light
suspended over the door served to indicate that it had
other uses than those of an ordinary dwelling.</p>

<p>A light rain was now falling, and before the boy had
time to ask his companion if some mistake had not been
made in the place Dudley opened the door and pushed
him inside.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">THE PLOT THAT FAILED.</p>

<p>Vance found himself in a narrow, dimly-lighted hallway.</p>

<p>But before the sense of disappointment, not unmixed,
perhaps, with a feeling of uneasiness, had time to assert
itself, Dudley brushed by him and opened a door which
admitted them to a long, low-ceiled room, painted a dull,
smoky color, but brilliantly illuminated with many gas
jets enclosed in colored globes, which threw a subdued and
fantastic glow about the room.</p>

<p>There was a kitchen in the rear and a bar along one
side near the door.</p>

<p>The rest of the room was taken up with round, well-polished
mahogany tables of different sizes, for large or
small parties.</p>

<p>It was a restaurant all right, but entirely different from
anything Vance had ever before visited.</p>

<p>The tone of the place was wholly English, as Dudley
had intimated to his companion, and the bill of fare was
limited to broiled meats and fish, fowl, oysters and rarebits.</p>

<p>The place was chiefly noted for its fine old English ales.</p>

<p>For all that, Bagley’s was a notorious place.</p>

<p>Its frequenters were mostly crooks, gamblers and politicians.</p>

<p>Curiosity and its famous cuisine, however, brought
thither a sprinkling of the better classes—men about town,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
salesmen and their out-of-town customers, lawyers, brokers,
merchants, and the sons of rich parents who thought
it the correct thing to be seen there.</p>

<p>The upper floors were divided into supper rooms for
ladies and their escorts, and it was quite a fad among the
upper crust of Kansas City aristocracy to drop in there
after the theater.</p>

<p>Mr. Bagley himself, rotund and red-faced, lounged in
a big easy chair behind the cashier’s desk near the entrance.</p>

<p>The room was nearly crowded at that hour, and while
Vance was surveying the place with much interest a waiter
approached Dudley and handed him a card.</p>

<p>“We’ll go upstairs, Vance,” said the dapper gentleman
gaily. “I’ll introduce you to a friend of mine.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he hooked his arm in Thornton’s and,
preceded by the waiter, they passed out again into the
entry and walked up a couple of flights of richly-carpeted
stairs, down to the end of a corridor, where a window
opened on a gloomy prospect of dark roofs and irregular
black voids.</p>

<p>The waiter rapped on one of the doors that lined this
corridor, and a voice shouted, “Come in.”</p>

<p>The attendant stepped aside and permitted Dudley to
usher Vance into a well-lighted room and the presence
of a dark-complexioned gentleman in full evening dress and
a young lady of unquestioned beauty, that was heightened
by her chic air.</p>

<p>They had just been served with supper, the chief dish
being grilled bones.</p>

<p>There were bottles of wine and ale on the table, and
the couple seemed to be enjoying themselves hugely.</p>

<p>“Hello, Dudley! You’re just in time. You’ll have
supper with us, of course—you and your friend. Waiter,
take the order.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” responded the dapper young man; then, turning
to the lady, whom he evidently knew, he said, “Miss
Miller, this is Vance Thornton.”</p>

<p>The young lady bowed with a sweet smile and a fascinating
glance.</p>

<p>“Carrington,” continued Dudley, turning to the gentleman,
“let me make you acquainted with my friend Thornton.
Vance, this is Sid Carrington.”</p>

<p>“Glad to know you, Thornton,” said Carrington, rising
and extending his hand.</p>

<p>The boy acknowledged both introductions in a suitable
manner and then took the seat pointed out to him, which
was close to Miss Miller.</p>

<p>“Vance, like myself, is merely paying a flying visit to
Kansas City on business,” explained Dudley, and then he
and Carrington began to talk together, leaving the boy
and Miss Miller to entertain themselves.</p>

<p>There was nothing backward about Miss Miller, for
after Vance had given a modest order to the attendant she
proceeded at once to make herself agreeable to the lad.</p>

<p>“So you’re a stranger in Kansas City, Mr. Thornton?
Are you from Chicago?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Vance, who was not a little impressed
by the lady’s loveliness, as well as her fascinating ways.</p>

<p>“Chicago is a most delightful city,” she exclaimed gushingly.
“I lived there for many years myself. The young
men of Chicago are so bright and manly; it is really a
pleasure to meet one of them way out here,” and she
flashed such a look at Vance as almost took his breath
away.</p>

<p>During the twenty minutes the newcomers had to wait
to be served the lady ate but little, but she talked and
laughed enough to make up the difference.</p>

<p>Every little charm she possessed she threw into her conversation,
and she made many adroit inquiries of Vance
as to when he left Chicago, where he had been before
he came to Kansas City, where he expected to go next and
when, what his business was, and many other suggestive
queries, all of which the boy parried skilfully or replied to
as he thought prudent, though he had not the slightest suspicion
that the lady had any other object than mere womanly
curiosity in asking them.</p>

<p>An acute observer would probably have noticed that she
was not entirely pleased with the result when the conversation
became general.</p>

<p>An almost imperceptible signal passed between her and
Sid Carrington when that gentleman finally favored her
with a significant look of inquiry.</p>

<p>He understood at once, and made a remark to Dudley
in a low tone, at which the dapper young man shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p>“What do you drink, Thornton?” asked Carrington as
the waiter stood by expectantly. “You can have anything
you want, but this house is particularly noted for its imported
ales. I’ll order a bottle for you.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” Vance hastened to say, “but I really don’t
drink anything.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Sid, a slight cloud forming on his
brow, while Miss Miller looked up in great surprise.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” interposed Dudley. “He doesn’t touch
anything in that line. I found that out to-day at the Criterion.
You’ll take coffee, however, won’t you, Vance?”</p>

<p>Vance nodded.</p>

<p>“A bottle of your XXX ale, waiter, and a cup of coffee
for this gentleman,” said Guy Dudley briskly.</p>

<p>The attendant bowed and departed.</p>

<p>“So you really don’t drink?” said Miss Miller with an
artful smile. “This is quite a surprise to me, for I thought
every gentleman indulged in something or other. Now,
couldn’t I prevail on you to take just a thimbleful of this
light Madeira? As a special favor, with me, you know?”</p>

<p>She favored Vance with an arch look as she filled two
small wineglasses with the amber liquid, as if to imply
it was an honor she was especially according him.</p>

<p>“Really, Miss Miller——” protested Vance, feeling
much embarrassed.</p>

<p>“You will oblige me, won’t you?”</p>

<p>She placed one of the glasses close to his fingers and
raised the other toward her ruby lips, with a look so seductive
as to be almost irresistible.</p>

<p>Vance was confused at his position and somewhat bewildered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
by the coquettish and persistent attitude of the
fair lady at his elbow.</p>

<p>He felt, without actually seeing, that the eyes of the
two gentlemen were fixed upon him at that moment.</p>

<p>As his fingers grasped the slender stem of the wineglass
and he half drew it toward him, a gleam of unholy
triumph seemed to dart from three pairs of eyes.</p>

<p>But their satisfaction was premature.</p>

<p>Suddenly before Vance’s vision passed the face of his
gentle, white-haired mother in Chicago, whom he had promised
faithfully that he would never drink a drop of intoxicating
liquor.</p>

<p>He drew back his hand.</p>

<p>His muscles tightened, and he looked his fair tempter
squarely in the face as he said:</p>

<p>“I regret I cannot oblige you, Miss Miller; but I promised
my mother I would not drink, and it is impossible
that I can go back on my word.”</p>

<p>Vance Thornton was himself again.</p>

<p>Sadie Miller had not found him such an easy proposition
after all.</p>

<p>A look of chagrin rested for a moment on the lady’s
face, while Sid Carrington uttered a strong invective under
his breath.</p>

<p>But the affair was instantly passed off with a laugh,
and the boy found himself once more at his ease.</p>

<p>The coffee for Vance and the ale for Dudley presently
arrived, and then another slight signal was made by the
host which the girl understood.</p>

<p>The conspirators were about to play their last card.</p>

<p>In the most natural way imaginable Dudley attracted
Vance’s attention for a moment, and the boy half turned
away from Miss Miller.</p>

<p>During that instant she leaned slightly forward, extended
her arm and dropped something into the coffee.</p>

<p>It was all done in a moment, and when Vance turned
again to the young lady she was in the act of drinking
from her own glass of Madeira.</p>

<p>He drank the coffee at intervals as he polished off a
grilled bone, quite unsuspicious that he had fallen into the
snare at last.</p>

<p>The effects of the drug became evident to the watchful
eyes of the three conspirators before Vance began to realize
there was anything the matter with him.</p>

<p>At length he experienced the insidious feeling of heaviness
and torpor characteristic of a dose of chloral or knockout
drops.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better—go?” he blurted out in a thick, hesitating
tone to Dudley, who was talking to Carrington.</p>

<p>“What for? There’s no hurry. We’ll all go together
presently,” was the reply of the dapper young man.</p>

<p>Vance looked helplessly at Miss Miller, his eyes, hitherto
so alert and bright, now half closed and dull.</p>

<p>He half rose in his chair with a muttered exclamation,
sank back, swayed a bit to and fro, and then utterly
collapsed.</p>

<p>“He’s safe!” cried Carrington with sudden energy, rising
to his feet. “Quick, Dudley; see if he has the papers
on him, and secure them before the waiter turns up.”</p>

<p>In an instant Vance’s treacherous companion was searching
him with a swiftness called forth by the urgency of
the occasion.</p>

<p>But pocket after pocket failed to yield the desired results.</p>

<p>The option vouchers not yet presented for settlement,
and such warehouse receipts as the boy was supposed to
have about his person, were not to be found.</p>

<p>In fact, not a document of any kind relating to his trip
was in evidence.</p>

<p>“Curse the luck!” exclaimed Carrington, who appeared
to be engineering the conspiracy. “We’re euchred after
all! What has he done with them?”</p>

<p>Miss Miller, who had been watching the abortive efforts
of Guy Dudley with a slight curl on her pretty lips, now
spoke.</p>

<p>“Evidently the boy is smarter than you have given him
credit for,” she said with a tantalizing laugh. “I suspected
it almost from the start. Why, he didn’t give a
single thing away the whole time I was doing my best to
pump him. You’ll have to try something else, Sid, if
you expect to reach results.”</p>

<p>Just then the waiter appeared at the door with the bill.</p>

<p>“What’s the number of your cab, Dudley?” asked Carrington
as he handed the attendant a bill.</p>

<p>“No. 206.”</p>

<p>“Call up 206 and 93, waiter, and then you’ll have to
help us get our friend here to the walk. Your coffee has
been too much for him.”</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">ELEVATORVILLE.</p>

<p>Vance woke up next morning with a severe headache.</p>

<p>He was in bed in his room at the hotel.</p>

<p>His thinking powers were somewhat mixed, and he wondered
what had occurred to him.</p>

<p>“I don’t recollect coming to bed,” he muttered in a perplexed
tone. “Where was I last night?”</p>

<p>He did not even remember that he had been to the
theater.</p>

<p>After lying motionless in bed a good fifteen minutes
staring at the ceiling he gave the problem up for a bad job.</p>

<p>“What time is it, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Gee! Nearly ten o’clock! I’ll have to hustle if I am
going to get any breakfast in this house to-day. Something
is wrong with me, that’s sure. I never felt this
way before.”</p>

<p>He began to dress, and then gave his face and head a
good sousing, which made him feel better.</p>

<p>“I look as if I had been out with the boys all night,”
he said, observing his bloodshot eyes and pallid expression.
“I’d give something to know what has knocked me out.”</p>

<p>He did not feel hungry, but he believed a cup of coffee
would do him good.</p>

<p>On his way from the elevator to the dining-room he
stopped at the office and asked the clerk if he had any idea
when he came in last evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>“You’ll have to see the night man about that,” replied
the spruce young man with a quizzical smile. “Been having
a good time, I suppose. Better get a bromo-seltzer
before you eat. Step into the drug store, right through
the corridor, and he’ll fix you up all right.”</p>

<p>Vance thought the clerk’s advice was good and he followed
it, after which he went into breakfast.</p>

<p>It was not long before the events of the preceding evening
began to fashion themselves in his brain, and the situation
dawned upon him.</p>

<p>“But I didn’t drink anything at that place,” he persisted
to himself, “that is, nothing but a cup of coffee.
Perhaps strong coffee at midnight doesn’t agree with me,
as I’m not used to it. All the same, it’s funny I don’t
remember a thing about how the affair wound up, or how
I got back and into my bed upstairs.”</p>

<p>The reflection annoyed him a good bit.</p>

<p>“That Miss Miller is a fine looking girl, all right,”
he mused, trying to devote his attention to the morning’s
report about the corn market; “I don’t think I ever met
such an attractive person. Still, I think I prefer Bessie.
And the chap that was with her—I forget his name—he
seems to be a pretty swell party. Seems to me I’ve seen
him before. If I have, of course it was in Chicago. I
wonder if Dudley will be around looking for me this
morning? I don’t fancy him much, although he certainly
treated me away up in G. I’m sorry on the whole I met
him, for if he returns to town before me he’ll probably
mention that he met me out here, and that’s just what
Mr. Whitemore doesn’t want. If it should get about that
I was on a night racket with him it’s bound to hurt me.
I guess I’d better cut Dudley out by taking an early train
for Grainville.”</p>

<p>As this seemed to be good policy, Vance hastened to
settle with the hotel people, and having found that he
could get a train for his destination at 1:30 p. m., he
snatched a hasty lunch, hired a cab, and reached the station
in plenty of time to board the through accommodation.</p>

<p>Arrived at Grainville, he went to the best hotel in town
and registered, depositing his documents, as usual, in the
office safe.</p>

<p>Next morning he visited the two elevator concerns he
had to do business with, settled the differences without
trouble, and took a call on the grain, sending his vouchers
off to Chicago in the usual way.</p>

<p>From there he went to other important grain centers
in Kansas, where the balance of his options were to be
settled, closing up that part of the business finally in Jayville,
Missouri.</p>

<p>“There, that winds up the option business,” he remarked
with an air of relief as he registered the last of his vouchers
for Chicago.</p>

<p>Consulting his letter of instructions, he found that he
had to proceed to a town called Elevatorville, on the Mississippi,
facing the State of Kentucky.</p>

<p>The branch railroad that connected the place with the
nearest trunk line was a rocky affair, and had fallen into
the hands of a receiver owing to a default in the interest
on its first mortgage bonds.</p>

<p>Evidently transportation business had fallen off badly
in that section.</p>

<p>Vance made cautious inquiries at the junction as to
whether much grain had passed over the branch road
lately, but nobody seemed to know anything about the
matter.</p>

<p>The regular station agent was sick in bed, and the substitute
assured Vance that there was nothing doing in
that line.</p>

<p>The boy took the late afternoon train for Elevatorville,
arriving at the town long after dark.</p>

<p>A solitary, worn-out hotel ’bus was backed up against
the station platform.</p>

<p>Vance, grip in hand, was stepping over to take it, when
it suddenly struck him that perhaps he had better not go
to the hotel.</p>

<p>If he could obtain accommodation at some house in the
suburbs his presence in the place would probably attract
less attention.</p>

<p>There might be nothing in it after all, but he proposed
to omit no precaution having a bearing on his secret
mission.</p>

<p>So he asked a husky looking boy he noticed standing
around if he knew of any place in the vicinity where he
could find board and lodging for a few days.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you a place, mister.”</p>

<p>The country boy took him around to an unpretentious
cottage, where he secured what he wanted at very reasonable
terms.</p>

<p>Feeling that some excuse was in order, he explained to
the elderly spinster who owned the house that he thought
Elevatorville might improve his health.</p>

<p>“You don’t look a bit sick,” she ventured, looking him
over with critical consideration.</p>

<p>“That’s right, madam; but you can’t always tell by appearances,”
replied Vance with a politeness that quite
charmed her.</p>

<p>“True,” she answered. “I remember my niece Mary
Ann looked the very picture of health when she came here
to visit me, and before she was here a week she took down
sick with liver complaint and nearly died.”</p>

<p>“Just so, madam,” said Vance, with an amused smile.</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t be sick, young man,” she continued
anxiously; “but if you should be, I can recommend my
nephew, who is the best doctor in town.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bear your relative in mind if I should need his
services,” replied the boy, stifling a grin.</p>

<p>“I s’pose you feel kind of hungry, don’t you? Come by
the train, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>Vance admitted that he could eat a trifle if she would
be so good as to prepare something.</p>

<p>“The fire is out, but I can light it up again. I can’t
promise you any delicacies, but we don’t stint ourselves.
I’m right glad to get a boarder these hard times, and will
make you feel at home. It’s a wonder you didn’t go right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
to the hotel, though if you can’t afford it you’ve done right
to come here.”</p>

<p>If the lady was surprised at Vance’s healthy appetite,
she discreetly made no reference to it, beyond remarking
that she was glad to see he enjoyed the meal.</p>

<p>Vance was up early next morning, and after a satisfactory
breakfast sallied out on a tour of observation.</p>

<p>The place wore a dormant air, a surprising fact for a
western river town.</p>

<p>Vance judged that it had been struck by a temporary
setback of some sort, which happened to be the fact.</p>

<p>The boy saw the outlines of five big elevator buildings
in the distance down by the river, and he strolled over
in that direction.</p>

<p>He avoided the main business streets, going toward the
great Mississippi by a roundabout way that brought him
to the river bank a mile above the objects that he aimed at.</p>

<p>He smiled to himself at the idea of taking so much
trouble, which in the end might prove to have been time
spent to no purpose; but when he drew near to the doorway
leading to the office of the first elevator he suddenly
came to a different conclusion.</p>

<p>For there, sunning himself on an inverted cask outside
of the entrance, he spied a familiar figure.</p>

<p>A quick glance at the person’s face enabled Vance to
identify him.</p>

<p>It was the dapper young Chicagoian, Guy Dudley, as
large as life.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">THE REASON WHY VANCE THORNTON WAS TICKLED ALMOST
TO DEATH.</p>

<p>“What the dickens is he doing in Elevatorville?” ejaculated
Vance in great astonishment. “I thought he was
attending to business for his father in Kansas City.”</p>

<p>Just then a man in a sack-coat and wearing a smart-looking
fedora hat came to the door and entered into conversation
with Dudley.</p>

<p>Presently the dapper young man jumped off his perch,
and the two began to walk toward the spot where Vance
stood regarding them with some curiosity.</p>

<p>“It will never do for him to see me here,” muttered
the boy, backing out of view and then walking rapidly
down a path that led to that end of the elevator which
faced the water. “He’d ask no end of embarrassing
questions which I never could answer.”</p>

<p>When Vance reached the corner of the elevator building
he found that further progress in that direction was
blocked by the water, unless he chose to crawl over the
damp sand under the ground floor of the edifice, which was
raised several feet on spiles.</p>

<p>So he concluded to wait where he was until the coast
was clear again.</p>

<p>He looked back to see if Dudley and his companion were
continuing on up the street, but to his dismay he saw
they also had turned into the path leading down to the
river end of the building.</p>

<p>There was nothing now but to get out of sight under
the corner of the elevator and wait for them to retire.</p>

<p>“How long do you expect to stay in this burg, Mr.
Dudley?” the man in the fedora hat was saying as the
pair came within earshot of Vance’s post of concealment.</p>

<p>“Give it up,” returned the dapper young man, with
a yawn. “It’s precious dull here, all right; but I’ve got
to stick here until I find out whether that Thornton chap”—at
these words Vance pricked up his ears and was instantly
on the alert—“is coming down here on a reconnoitering
expedition for his boss, old man Whitemore, or
not. Those are my orders, and I got them right from the
shoulder, too.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think he is coming here?” asked the
elevator man curiously.</p>

<p>“We have our reasons,” replied Dudley significantly,
“and we’re not taking any chances. I’m watching every
train that comes in.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see you at the depot last night.”</p>

<p>“I don’t have to go to the depot. He’ll go to the hotel
as sure as guns, or to the Stag House.”</p>

<p>“Or to the Parker House,” suggested the man in the
fedora.</p>

<p>“Scarcely there. He’s got plenty of money and will want
the best that is to be had. However, I don’t care where
he goes; the moment he registers at any of these places
I shall be informed.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said the other interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll point him out to you, and it will be up to
you to see that he’s blocked at every point.”</p>

<p>“As every one of our men down here has been fixed, I
don’t think he’ll find out a heap,” remarked the elevator
official in a tone of conviction.</p>

<p>“However, there’s nothing like making assurance doubly
sure, Mr. Taggart,” said Dudley, taking out his cigarette
case. “Have a smoke?”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” and his companion helped himself to one.</p>

<p>“The whole trouble seems to have developed from the
fact that our ally, Vyce—that’s old Whitemore’s bookkeeper—has
come under the suspicion of his employer,
though it isn’t likely anything can be brought against him.
When the combination was forming Carrington found out
Vyce could be bought. He had his price—most everybody
has—and an arrangement was effected by which he was
to keep the opposition pool informed of Whitemore’s operations
in this new deal of his as far as he was able to find
them out.”</p>

<p>“That was a great advantage,” said Mr. Taggart, wagging
his head sagaciously.</p>

<p>“Well, say, you’ve no idea what it counts for. Whitemore
has been dominating the bull clique for years. All
sorts of jobs have been put up to him, but he has managed
to wriggle out somehow. This time we believe it is his
object to corner the market, and the combination which
is after his scalp is backed by one of the strongest banks
in Chicago. I fancy it is strong enough to squeeze him.
If we should catch him we’ll wring him bone-dry. We’ll
bankrupt him as sure as my name is Guy Dudley.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>The dapper young man lit another cigarette and continued:</p>

<p>“As I was saying, Vyce, our source of information on
the inside, has suddenly dried up. Whitemore hasn’t accused
him of any underhanded dealings, but the very fact
that he has shut up tighter than a clam toward his confidential
assistant, and has sent young Thornton—a mere
boy, you might say—west to close up his corn options, is
a sure sign that the old man is suspicious of Vyce. Ever
since that boy left Chicago we have reason to suspect that
Whitemore has been quietly buying every bushel of corn
that is offered, though his regular brokers do not appear
in these transactions. If this is a fact, he must own more
than half of the visible supply on the market.”</p>

<p>“He must have a barrel of money.”</p>

<p>“I’d be satisfied with half of what I could raise on his
real estate. It was a slick and farseeing move on the part
of the pool to sneak five million bushels down here without
the fact getting out. That was accomplished early in
the game by working our pull with the Mississippi Transportation
Co. Nothing like having an influential director
or two at your back.”</p>

<p>The man in the fedora hat nodded.</p>

<p>“These elevators have been duly reported out of business
for one reason or another.”</p>

<p>“I can’t see how you managed to keep the papers in the
dark. What they can’t ferret out isn’t worth knowing.”</p>

<p>Guy Dudley laughed sardonically.</p>

<p>“The combination simply bought up half a dozen of
the leading papers, and own them body and soul. They
print only what we want on the corn question. They mold
public opinion, as it were. The other papers copy our
news, and there you are—see?”</p>

<p>Mr. Taggart thought he saw, for he rubbed his hands
and laughed.</p>

<p>“But in dealing with such an artful old fox as Jared
Whitemore we have to provide against the unusual and
the unexpected. It was distinctly unusual for him to
send a boy like Vance Thornton to close up his options—yet
that is what he has done, and we should never have
got on to it if it had not been for the uncommon shrewdness
of our man Vyce. If he has done this, there is no
reason why he hasn’t instructed the boy to come down
here after he has finished with the options and try to find
out whether the press reports concerning these elevators
are really founded on facts, or whether they have been
cooked up by the opposition forces.”</p>

<p>“And do you think that young fellow Thornton is smart
enough for such a slick job as that?” asked Mr. Taggart,
with a sneer.</p>

<p>“Do I? Well, say, he’s all right, and don’t you make
any mistake on that head,” said Dudley in a convincing
tone as he gave the rim of his hat a flip backward. “Carrington
says he’s smart enough to be dangerous, and Carrington
is no fool.”</p>

<p>“Yet he’s only a boy, you say?” said Mr. Taggart,
skeptically.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. He was clever enough to block a
little game we put up on him in Kansas City, and he
didn’t even suspect our intentions, either.”</p>

<p>“How was that?” asked Mr. Taggart, with some interest.</p>

<p>“Carrington came down himself from Chicago to help
the thing along, and brought one of his handsomest lady
stenographers along to pump the boy dry. And she did
it, too; oh, yes, she did it—nit! And we thought he would
be such an easy proposition. We wanted to find out all
his plans and get possession of the options we supposed
he carried about in his clothes.”</p>

<p>“And you failed, eh?”</p>

<p>“We failed all right. He didn’t have as much as a toothpick
about him, and so, after dosing his coffee, for he
doesn’t drink a drop of liquor, we had all our trouble for
nothing. The girl went into a spasm of admiration over
Thornton’s cleverness in being prepared for the unexpected,
while Carrington was madder than a whole nest of hornets.
I took him to his hotel and put him to bed, and that’s
the last I’ve seen of him.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, you hear me,” said the man in the fedora
hat, thumping the side of the bunch of spiles behind which
Vance was listening to this enlightening conversation, “if
he comes down here and gets away with a grain of information
as big as one grain of those five million bushels stored
in these, five elevators, I’ll give you leave to kick me from
here to the mouth of the Mississippi.”</p>

<p>The remark was emphatic and forcible, and there was
not the slightest doubt that Mr. Taggart meant every
word of it, yet is it any wonder that Vance Thornton,
under the circumstances, grinned as he had never grinned
before in all his life?</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">THE MAN FROM THE WEST.</p>

<p>If Guy Dudley and Mr. Taggart, the manager of the
five elevators of Elevatorville, only suspected the injury
they had inflicted on their cause by coming down to the
water’s edge of that particular elevator under which Vance
Thornton happened to be concealed at the time, and there
telling all they knew to the winds, as they thought, there
is not the least doubt that they would have felt like going
to some quiet place and kicking themselves off the earth.</p>

<p>The dapper Mr. Dudley thought himself as smart as
they make them in Chicago, but really he had lots to
learn.</p>

<p>He was satisfied that young Thornton could not poke
his nose into the town without he (Dudley) becoming
immediately aware of the fact.</p>

<p>Yet Vance had already been more than twelve hours
in Elevatorville without the dapper young man’s knowledge,
and had practically accomplished the object of his
visit through the indiscreet loquacity of the gentlemen
who were “laying” for him.</p>

<p>The only really good thing that Dudley had been guilty
of was his admission of Thornton’s cleverness.</p>

<p>Dudley and the manager of the elevators, having unwittingly
put Vance Thornton in possession of more information
even than he had expected to pick up in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
western river town, walked back the way they had come
and parted at the corner of the street, the dapper young
man returning to his hotel.</p>

<p>“Well,” murmured Vance, as he emerged from his place
of concealment, “if this hasn’t been the greatest piece of
luck I’ve ever heard tell of, I don’t know what luck is.
So there’s actually five million bushels of corn in these
elevators, while they are officially reported as empty? I’m
much obliged to you, Mr. Taggart, for the information,”
and he looked after the retreating figures of the manager
and his companion. “So that was a put-up job on me
at Bagley’s chop-house, eh? And I never dreamed of it.
At last I am on to you, Mr. Guy Dudley, and I think
you’ve done all the damage you’re likely to do to Mr.
Whitemore. And our respectable bookkeeper, Mr. Edgar
Vyce, is a snake in the grass. I’ll have to lose no time
in putting Mr. Whitemore next to all these important facts.
When he learns the real state of affairs I guess Mr. Vyce
will have to join the opposition in person as well as in
spirit. I never did like him much, and now I certainly
despise him. A sneak and a traitor ought always to be
handled without gloves.”</p>

<p>By this time the road was clear for Vance to retire
without attracting special attention to himself, and half
an hour later he was seated at a table in the cottage writing
a letter to his employer.</p>

<p>That afternoon he left Elevatorville by a river boat that
carried him a few miles up the Mississippi to another town
that boasted of a pair of dismantled elevators.</p>

<p>He had no difficulty in personally examining these buildings,
and found that the newspaper report as to their condition
was strictly true.</p>

<p>Vance added a postscript to his letter, setting forth the
facts as he had found them, and then forwarded it
by registered mail, as usual.</p>

<p>“I suppose Guy Dudley is watching for the train to
deposit me in Elevatorville this evening,” he grinned as
he sat on the hotel veranda after supper. “Gee! It was
a lucky thought of mine not to go to the hotel last night.
Had I done so my name would probably have been mud,
so far as finding out what I came for, and then I should
never have found out those other little matters. It’s better
to be born lucky than rich.”</p>

<p>Next morning Vance left for a railway junction town
in Missouri, the last point he had on his list.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to go into the particulars of his business
at this place.</p>

<p>It is enough to say that it had a direct bearing on his
employer’s plans, and the boy managed to obtain all the
necessary information to be got.</p>

<p>“Now for Chicago and home,” said Vance, in a happy
frame of mind, after he had boiled down his statistics in
a succinct letter to Mr. Whitemore and sent it off.</p>

<p>The boy uttered these words as he was coming out of
the postoffice, which was located on the corner of two
streets.</p>

<p>Immediately preceding him was a tall and commanding
man, with a swarthy complexion and black eyes.</p>

<p>Vance had noticed him inside posting a letter.</p>

<p>He wore a soft felt hat of generous proportions, and
his manner was the free and easy way of the wide west.</p>

<p>The boy stopped and watched him with some curiosity
as he started to cross the street.</p>

<p>At that moment a noisy racket arose around the corner,
and there suddenly came into view a team of horses attached
to a heavy wagon of produce.</p>

<p>Evidently the animals were frightened, and were dashing
about in a blind, purposeless race.</p>

<p>The stranger was right in their path, and seeing his
peril, he sprang back.</p>

<p>But in some unaccountable way he missed his footing,
slipped and fell upon the roadway.</p>

<p>A dozen or more people besides Vance noticed his mishap,
but only the boy seemed to have presence of mind
enough to take any action.</p>

<p>The frenzied horses were almost upon the fallen man
when Vance, darting out from the sidewalk, seized the
near animal by the bridle-rein, as well as getting a secure
grip on the harness with the other hand, and succeeded
in slightly veering the team out of its course.</p>

<p>Off course he was instantly carried off his feet and placed
in an exceedingly dangerous situation, but he had accomplished
his object.</p>

<p>The wheels of the heavy wagon barely grazed the stranger’s
head as it flew by, but he was saved—saved by Vance’s
remarkable nerve and quick movements.</p>

<p>The runaways, handicapped by his weight, and headed
off by several men who now jumped into the roadway and
waved their coats and hats, lost their speed and were presently
brought to a standstill.</p>

<p>“Young man,” exclaimed a broad-shouldered Missourian,
grasping Vance by the hand, as with rumpled clothes and
minus his hat he let go his hold and staggered back from
the restive and trembling horses, “that was one of the
pluckiest things I reckon I’ve seen for a long time.”</p>

<p>“That’s what it was, so help me Bob!” cried another
demonstrative individual, pressing himself to the fore.
“Shake, youngster!”</p>

<p>A crowd quickly gathered around the boy, and everybody
wanted to take him by the hand and tell him what
they thought of his feat.</p>

<p>“Here’s your hat!” cried some one on the outskirts of the
circle.</p>

<p>Half a dozen willing hands were extended to grasp and
restore it to its owner.</p>

<p>It was really extraordinary what an interest the onlookers
had suddenly taken in the Chicago boy.</p>

<p>“Oh, come now,” objected Vance, trying to disengage
himself from his well-meaning admirers, “I’m really much
obliged to you; but I think you might let a fellow go
now.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve got to drink with us before we can let you
part company,” cried one officious six-foot native.</p>

<p>“You must excuse me,” said Vance, moving off, “but
I don’t drink.”</p>

<p>“You don’t drink!” exclaimed several of the men in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
breath, falling back at what seemed to them a most unheard-of
statement. “Did you say that you didn’t drink?”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I did say, and I generally mean
what I say,” answered the boy in a firm tone.</p>

<p>As Vance elbowed his way clear of the mob every one
looked at him with the same curiosity they might have
bestowed upon some new and extraordinary animal which
had unexpectedly dropped in among them.</p>

<p>A fellow that did not drink was decidedly something out
of the common in Missouri.</p>

<p>Vance, however, was rescued from this disagreeable situation
by the man whose life he had saved.</p>

<p>The big fellow stepped up, and linking his arm with
the lad’s, drew him off down the street, saying, in a very
pleasant and somewhat musical voice:</p>

<p>“Let us get away from this mob, my young friend; I
fancy their well-meant intentions are not particularly
agreeable to either of us. I can see that you don’t care
to be made a hero of, though I never knew one who more
deserved the honor.”</p>

<p>He spoke in such a breezy, whole-souled way that Vance
was instantly prepossessed in his favor.</p>

<p>Though he showed the flavor of the untrammeled West
in every movement, yet there was nothing rough about
him.</p>

<p>He was a gentleman from heel to crown.</p>

<p>“I am very glad you were not injured by the runaway,
sir,” said Vance sincerely.</p>

<p>“Thanks to your nerve and presence of mind, I was
not; but I had a narrow call for my life. I owe my preservation
to you, my brave lad, and I wish you to understand
that I am deeply grateful to you. You must let me
know your name, for I insist that we shall be better acquainted.”</p>

<p>“My name is Vance Thornton.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; and mine is William Bradhurst.”</p>

<p>“I am pleased to know you, Mr. Bradhurst,” said Vance
heartily.</p>

<p>“Not more than I am to know you,” replied the man
from the West. “You are a stranger to this town, I should
judge.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I am from Chicago.”</p>

<p>“You interest me. I am bound for that city myself.
I expect to take the afternoon train for St. Louis, to connect
with the Panhandle road.”</p>

<p>“I intend to leave to-day for Chicago by the same route,”
said Vance, pleased with the prospect of having so agreeable
a companion.</p>

<p>“I am delighted to hear it, my dear fellow,” answered
the westerner, in a tone which indicated his satisfaction.
“We will go together, if you have no objection.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to have your society,” assented the boy.</p>

<p>“Good. I was wondering how I would relieve the monotony
of the trip. You have settled the matter in the
way I should have preferred.”</p>

<p>By this time they were several blocks from the scene
of their thrilling adventure.</p>

<p>“Where are you stopping?” asked the big fellow.</p>

<p>“At the Planters’ House.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s where I have put up. If you don’t mind
we’ll go there now. It is nearly lunch hour. Anyhow,
I’d like to have a talk with you.”</p>

<p>To this invitation Vance offered no objection, and ten
minutes later they were ascending the hotel elevator together.</p>

<p class="h2sub">DAME FORTUNE TAKES VANCE THORNTON UNDER HER WING.</p>

<p>“Well, Thornton, I trust that you and I will be good
friends,” said Mr. Bradhurst, as he motioned Vance to a
seat by the window after they had entered one of the best
suites of rooms in the house.</p>

<p>“I hope so, sir,” replied the boy in a cheery tone, which
indicated that he saw no reason, at least on his part, why
they should not.</p>

<p>“It isn’t every one that I take a fancy to,” said the
broad-shouldered man; “but I am bound to say that, even
apart from the natural friendliness I feel toward one
to whom I am so largely indebted as yourself, I have taken
a liking to you on general principles.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind to say so,” returned Vance; “I can
say the same thing as regards yourself.”</p>

<p>“Then we appear to be mutually pleased,” said Bradhurst
with a breezy laugh. “The fact of the matter is,
young man, I have lived for the last eight years in a sort
of rough-and-ready community, where a man’s character
comes to the surface without much effort on his part to
hold it down. We soon learn to size up those with whom
we are thrown into contact, and sift the honest fellow
from the worthless scamp.”</p>

<p>“You have lived in the mining districts, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“You’ve hit it right at the first guess, though I hardly
suppose I resemble a cowboy.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Vance; “still, you could easily be taken for
a prosperous ranch owner, or something of that sort.”</p>

<p>“That’s right enough, too. I don’t look much as though
I was afflicted with consumption, do I?” asked Bradhurst,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Why, no,” replied the boy in a tone of surprise.</p>

<p>“Well, eight years ago, a few years after I graduated
from Yale College and was beginning the life of a business
man in New York, my friends came to the conclusion
that I was marked for an early grave. I had the disease,
all right, so the doctors I consulted said, and was treated
for it; but I went from bad to worse, until it seemed only
a question of time when I was expected to step out. As
a last resort I was advised to give up everything and go
to Colorado. Well, I went.”</p>

<p>“And coming West cured you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t fancy so; it was the new life I lived. I kept
away from large towns and went into the wilderness. I
lived out in the open air. I bought a horse and rode about
a great deal. After awhile I found my strength returning
and my chest expanding, and in two years I could afford to
laugh at doctors.”</p>

<p>“And you never had a return of the old symptoms?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“Never. I think it is perfectly safe for me to return
to civilization again.”</p>

<p>“It must give you a great deal of satisfaction to know
that you have cheated the undertaker out of a job,” said
Vance with a laugh.</p>

<p>“I leave you to judge of that. But while it was solely
for the purpose of recruiting my health I came West, I
have also accomplished another satisfactory result.”</p>

<p>“And what is that?”</p>

<p>“I have made a fortune—and a mighty big one at that.”</p>

<p>“In eight years?”</p>

<p>“In six years. If you have fortune on your side a good
deal of money can be picked up in the wild and woolly
districts, as they are sometimes called.”</p>

<p>“I have often heard so,” admitted Vance interestedly.</p>

<p>“I was always interested in metallurgy, and studied
the subject pretty exhaustively before I had any idea of
putting my knowledge to practical use. While wandering
about at my own sweet will I used to do a little prospecting
for the fun of the thing, but I can’t say that I met
with any success. My luck began when I took up my
habitation in the Dead Man’s Creek mining district, Colorado.
By that time I had grown tired of doing nothing.
I was induced to buy an interest in a claim that at first
looked to be a good thing, but soon petered out. Still,
my mining information encouraged me to believe there was
a future in it. I bought my partners out for a trivial
sum, and from that moment superintended the working
of the mine myself. One day we struck a fine pay streak,
and when the news circulated I was beset with offers from
promoters who came there to examine into it. I refused
to sell, but was finally persuaded to form a company, and
dispose of a few shares at a high figure. That was four
years ago. The mine turned out to be a real bonanza, and
my profits from the ore taken out up to a month ago have
been over $2,000,000.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Vance, opening his eyes; “you don’t
say!”</p>

<p>“I continued to hold ninety per cent of the stock, and
this I disposed of a little over a week ago for the
par value of $100 a share to a clique of wealthy men. I
realized $9,000,000.”</p>

<p>“Nine millions!” gasped Vance, who was astonished at
the sum, although he was accustomed to move in a business
atmosphere where transactions involving millions
were a common occurrence.</p>

<p>“Exactly—nine millions,” nodded Bradhurst, enjoying
his young acquaintance’s amazement. “So you see you
saved the life of a man actually worth $11,000,000 in cash
and securities. If my head had been smashed by that truck
those millions would have had no further interest for me.
While every man’s life is presumed to be his most precious
possession, mine has more than a usual value.”</p>

<p>“I should think it had,” said the boy, regarding his new
friend with a fresh interest.</p>

<p>“Under these circumstances, Thornton, you will understand
that if I presented you with a couple of millions
in consideration of what you have done for me I shouldn’t
be doing any too much to express my gratitude, and I
should still have more money on my hands than I could
ever reasonably hope to spend.”</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t think of doing such a foolish thing
as that,” said Vance, not a little disturbed at the mere
idea of being presented with such an enormous sum.</p>

<p>Perhaps the average person would have entertained different
views on the subject, but then Vance Thornton was
young, and had imbibed the idea that a man ought to earn
in a legitimate way all that he acquires.</p>

<p>He had full confidence in his own powers to accumulate
a million or two within the next few years, as soon as he
got well in harness.</p>

<p>Perhaps he was right.</p>

<p>Many a young man has been ruined, not only financially,
but morally, by getting next to a fortune without the
necessity of earning it.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradhurst possibly neglected to think of that side
of the question, for he said, with a smile:</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because I wouldn’t accept what I haven’t earned,”
replied the boy stoutly.</p>

<p>The western man regarded him with an amused smile.</p>

<p>All the same, he began to look upon the lad with a new
and increased respect.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said in an altered tone, “we’ll defer the discussion
of such a thing to another time. As a matter of
fact, my life, which you have presented to me, I may say,
is worth more than two millions. In fact, it is quite beyond
any financial value. Will you permit me to bestow
on you in return for it a lifelong friendship?”</p>

<p>There was no doubting the feeling which actuated those
words.</p>

<p>“I shall be only too glad to accept that,” replied Vance,
his strong, young face lighting up with pleasure.</p>

<p>“It’s a bargain,” said Bradhurst, extending his hand.
“Shake on it.”</p>

<p>Vance grasped his big brown hand, and with that handclasp
the glittering goddess of fortune hovered for an instant
over the boy’s head and touched him with the point
of one of her golden wings.</p>

<p>“I hope I haven’t talked you to death, Thornton,” said
the man from the golden West, rising and slapping the
lad familiarly on the back; “but as it is lunch hour, I
think we may as well go down to the dining-room and have
a bite.”</p>

<p>“I second the motion,” laughed Vance, getting on his
feet.</p>

<p>“The motion having been duly made and seconded, I
declare it carried, and this meeting stands adjourned pro
tempore.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">STRUCK DOWN.</p>

<p>Vance Thornton and his new friend William Bradhurst,
the many-times millionaire, expected to reach Chicago over
the P. C. C. and St. L. railroad at about seven o’clock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
on the morning following their departure from the Missouri
junction town.</p>

<p>Their calculations were correct, and the train was entering
the Union Depot, corner of Adams and Canal
streets, when Jared Whitemore, after a visit to the Chicago
National Bank, where he had received and perused
Vance’s last letter, mailed after his departure from Elevatorville,
was ascending to his office in the Rookery
building.</p>

<p>Bessie Brown looked up as Mr. Whitemore entered the
outer office, so also did Mr. Vyce, the bookkeeper.</p>

<p>Both noticed that their employer looked unusually stern.</p>

<p>The assistant bookkeeper was out attending to matters
that usually fell to Vance to transact.</p>

<p>Without looking either to the right or left, Mr. Whitemore
entered his private room.</p>

<p>Presently Bessie’s electric alarm buzzed, and she hastened
into the boss’ sanctum.</p>

<p>In a few minutes she returned to her machine, copied
a short letter addressed to Jarboe, Willicutt &amp; Co., locked
up her notebook and proceeded to put on her hat, an unusual
circumstance at that hour.</p>

<p>“Are you going out, Miss Brown?” inquired Mr. Vyce
in some surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Bessie coldly.</p>

<p>“Rather early for lunch, is it not?” he asked, coming
to the end of his desk and regarding her movements
curiously.</p>

<p>“I am not going to lunch.”</p>

<p>“Then you are going out on business for Mr. Whitemore,
I take it?”</p>

<p>Bessie made no answer, but having got her hat on
straight, she deliberately walked to the outer door and
passed into the corridor.</p>

<p>“You seem to be putting on a whole lot of airs with me,
young lady,” snarled the bookkeeper to the empty office;
“all of a sudden, too. You haven’t spoken a civil word
to me since that young cub Thornton went away on confidential
business for the old man. I shall make it my
business to take you down a peg or two. If I am not mistaken
in my calculations, you’ll be looking for a new job
before long, Bessie Brown—you and that young imp, curse
him! If I can keep you both out of the financial district
you may depend upon my exertions to that effect.”</p>

<p>At that moment his alarm went off, and sticking his
pen into the rack, he walked into the private office.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Mr. Vyce,” said the big corn operator curtly.
“You have been in my employ a matter of six years, I
think?”</p>

<p>“About that time,” replied the bookkeeper, rather taken
back by the question, which bore a fatally significant
bearing.</p>

<p>“During the last three years you have enjoyed a considerable
degree of my confidence, which has, if anything,
increased since the first of the year. How have you returned
this trust I reposed in you, sir?”</p>

<p>“How, sir?” faltered the bookkeeper, his guilty conscience
flying into his sallow face. “Why——”</p>

<p>“Mr. Vyce, for some weeks past I have had reason to
believe that some one conversant with certain plans of
mine was giving information to the clique that is
opposing me in the market. You are the only one to whom
I have opened my lips in this office. I have long regarded
you as my right-hand man—a man I thought I could
trust.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible that you accuse me, Mr. Whitemore?”
asked the bookkeeper, with an injured air.</p>

<p>“I do accuse you, Mr. Vyce, of playing the part of
traitor to my interests,” said the corn operator sternly.</p>

<p>“But, sir, unless you have some proof it is unfair——”</p>

<p>“I have the words of a certain Mr. Guy Dudley as
evidence that you sold yourself to the pool headed by Jarrett,
Palmer &amp; Carrington.”</p>

<p>At the mention of Dudley’s name Mr. Vyce turned as
pale as death.</p>

<p>“Guy Dudley!” he exclaimed in a trembling voice.
“Why, how could you have seen him? He is not in
Chicago.”</p>

<p>“I know that,” replied the operator sharply. “Perhaps
you can inform me where he is, since you and he appear
to be hand in glove.”</p>

<p>“As you have not seen him, how can you say you have
his evidence——”</p>

<p>“We will not argue that point. But if you are curious
to know how I obtained my information, I will say that
a confidential messenger of mine ran across your friend
Dudley and heard from that gentleman’s lips enough to
convict you of the charge I bring against you. If you
have anything to say in your defence that your conscience
would advise you to bring forward I will listen to you,
otherwise I will have to ask you to bring your connection
with this office to an immediate close.”</p>

<p>“You wish me to understand that you have received
this information through Vance Thornton?” asked Mr.
Vyce, with compressed lips and lowering brow.</p>

<p>“I have mentioned no name.”</p>

<p>“But you sent him out West.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” asked Mr. Whitemore curtly.</p>

<p>“He has been absent from the office for some ten days,
and as those options of yours were on the point of expiring,
I supposed——”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a fact that you advised Mr. Sidney Carrington
at once of Vance’s absence from this office, and suggested
your idea of his destination and purpose? And don’t you
know that Mr. Carrington, Mr. Dudley, and a woman connected
with their office, went to Kansas City for the express
purpose of blocking the boy’s mission by getting possession
of my options by foul means?”</p>

<p>“As you seem predisposed to my guilt, I see no use
in making any answer to your questions. I wish you to
understand that I brand your informant—whether he be
Vance Thornton, as I believe, or somebody else—as a liar.”</p>

<p>Mr. Vyce rose to his feet and walked out of the private
room.</p>

<p>He was furious with suppressed passion.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitemore followed him out almost immediately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
and went to the office safe, where he proceeded to unlock
a special compartment to which he only had access.</p>

<p>Edgar Vyce watched him with set white face and
venomous eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly an evil suggestion entered his soul and took
lodgment there.</p>

<p>He knew that documents of the greatest moment in
connection with the corn market were deposited in that
inner safe.</p>

<p>If he could only get possession of them he could make
his own terms with the pool in whose interests he had
practically lost his position.</p>

<p>If he could get possession of them!</p>

<p>There was nobody in the office at that moment but he
and Mr. Whitemore.</p>

<p>Suppose——</p>

<p>For a moment the blood congealed around his heart,
and he clutched at the desk to support himself.</p>

<p>The corn operator was about to relock the steel door.</p>

<p>It was now or never if he was to do anything.</p>

<p>Without waiting for the fiendish suggestion to cool he
seized a heavy ruler and, with a muttered imprecation,
sprang at the operator from behind.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitemore heard him and gave a startled glance
backward.</p>

<p>But he was at the infuriated man’s mercy.</p>

<p>Thud!</p>

<p>The ruler descended on the old operator’s head, and he
went down on the carpet like a stricken ox at the shambles.</p>

<p>At that identical instant Vance Thornton, dusty and
travel-stained, appeared at the office door.</p>

<p>He was a witness of the murderous attack.</p>

<p>With a cry of horror he sprang forward to aid his now
insensible employer.</p>

<p>“You here!” cried Vyce, turning on him with the rage
and despair of a man detected in the commission of a
desperate crime. “You shall never live to tell the story.”</p>

<p>In a moment they had grappled in a terrible struggle.</p>

<p>The boy, encumbered by his light overcoat, was at a
disadvantage.</p>

<p>The bookkeeper was strong, agile and desperate.</p>

<p>They swayed to and fro within the brass railings near
the safe, Vyce trying to get a grip on Vance’s throat.</p>

<p>At length the bookkeeper succeeded in tripping Thornton
so that he fell across the railing, and then he began to
pound the boy over the head and face with his fist.</p>

<p>The result was now no longer in doubt, for Vyce clearly
had the upper hand.</p>

<p>He intended to kill the lad, for he hated him as only
such a malignant nature can hate.</p>

<p>But fate willed it otherwise, else this story would not
have been written.</p>

<p>The outer door suddenly opened, and Bessie Brown appeared
in the opening.</p>

<p>With dilated eyes she looked a moment on the scene.</p>

<p>She recognized Vance Thornton and the awful situation
he was in.</p>

<p>Uttering a piercing scream that echoed through the corridors,
Bessie seized the first thing that came to her hand,
which happened to be a cane forgotten by a morning visitor,
and jumped to Vance’s assistance.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">THE CORN SITUATION.</p>

<p>The appearance of Bessie on the scene altered the state
of affairs materially.</p>

<p>Vyce realized that the scales had turned against him,
and that if he expected to evade the consequences of his
rash actions he had not a moment to lose.</p>

<p>With a bitter curse he cast the half-stunned boy from
him, grabbed his hat and coat, and started for the door.</p>

<p>Vance had fallen to the floor, and Bessie, paying no
further attention to the bookkeeper, ran to the boy, and
lifting his head in her arms, begged him to speak to her.</p>

<p>As Vyce passed hurriedly out into the corridor he
brushed against two clerks from an adjacent office who
had been attracted to the spot by the girl’s scream.</p>

<p>Before he reached the stairway he ran against others.</p>

<p>In fact, the entire floor had by this time been alarmed,
and a score of men were hurrying toward Mr. Whitemore’s
office.</p>

<p>“What’s the excitement about, Mr. Vyce?” asked the
elevator boy as the bookkeeper pushed himself into the
descending cage, which had stopped at his signal.</p>

<p>“An accident has happened to Mr. Whitemore,” he answered
in a hoarse voice. “I’m going for a doctor.”</p>

<p>By this ruse he managed to effect his escape from the
building.</p>

<p>In the meantime, while the office was filling with excited
people anxious to find out what had occurred, Vance
gradually recovered himself.</p>

<p>As soon as he could sit up Bessie got him a glass of
water, which he swallowed greedily.</p>

<p>Then he got on his feet.</p>

<p>“Thanks, Bessie; I feel all right now. Don’t crowd in
here, gentlemen,” he said, waving back the mob.</p>

<p>“What’s happened to Mr. Whitemore?” asked a stout
broker, peering over the railing at the unconscious corn
operator.</p>

<p>“He’s been hurt,” answered Vance. “I’d be obliged to
you, Mr. Bradley, if you will come inside and help me
get him into his private office.”</p>

<p>At that moment the assistant bookkeeper returned, and
was, of course, astonished to see such a crowd and commotion
in the place.</p>

<p>“You back, Vance?” he ejaculated. “What’s occurred
here?”</p>

<p>“Trouble,” replied the boy shortly. “Go out and fetch
a doctor for Mr. Whitemore. I’m afraid he’s seriously
injured.”</p>

<p>Vance and the stout broker having carried the corn
operator into his sanctum, they, with Bessie’s help, tried
to bring the insensible man to consciousness.</p>

<p>“Looks as if he had been struck by some heavy, blunt
instrument,” remarked Broker Bradley, examining the
jagged wound on Mr. Whitemore’s skull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“He was hit with the heavy office ruler,” said Vance
soberly.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” exclaimed the broker in surprise. “How did
that happen?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you, but for the present I hope you will
let it go no further.”</p>

<p>In the fewest words possible the boy told him what he
had seen as he entered the office; also how he had been
attacked by Vyce, and but for Bessie’s arrival would probably
have been fatally injured.</p>

<p>“The scoundrel! He must have been crazy!”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” replied Vance. “I can easily understand
how it came about; but for the present it is better I should
say nothing on the subject. Mr. Whitemore will know
how to deal with him when he recovers.”</p>

<p>“The police ought to be notified. I don’t like the looks
of Mr. Whitemore. He is a long time coming to.”</p>

<p>“We shall have a physician here soon,” said Vance.</p>

<p>“He breathes very hard,” said Bessie anxiously.</p>

<p>She had been bathing the operator’s face and chafing
his temples and hands with no satisfactory results.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the assistant bookkeeper appeared
with a doctor, who was immediately taken into the private
office.</p>

<p>Vance took advantage of this opportunity to clear the
outer office of those drawn there by curiosity and other
reasons.</p>

<p>He restored the ruler to its original position, locked the
private compartment of the safe and put the key in his
pocket.</p>

<p>Then he returned to the private room in time to see his
employer sit up with some difficulty.</p>

<p>The physician looked serious, as if he did not like the
aspect of the case.</p>

<p>“He had better be removed to his home at once and his
regular doctor sent for. His condition will not bear trifling
with.”</p>

<p>Mr. Whitemore’s eyes rested on Vance.</p>

<p>He beckoned him to his side.</p>

<p>“I am thankful you are back,” he whispered with great
difficulty. “I’m afraid I’m in a bad way. I’ve been struck
down at a critical moment. I depend on you to look after
the office. See my brokers. All my important papers are
in the inner compartment of the safe. Write an order that
I empower you to act for me until further notice and I
will sign it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t lose a moment in doing it, young man,” said
Broker Bradley, who was supporting the stricken corn
operator. “He seems to be growing weak fast.”</p>

<p>Vance drew up the paper, which was signed with great
trouble by Mr. Whitemore and witnessed by Broker Bradley
and Bessie.</p>

<p>“Now the check-book,” he gasped feebly. “I will sign
in blank. Fill it up by and bye with the amount of my
entire balance at the Chicago National.”</p>

<p>“He has wonderful confidence in you, Thornton,” Mr.
Bradley said, in great astonishment.</p>

<p>But the check was fated never to be signed.</p>

<p>As the pen was placed between the old corn operator’s
fluttering fingers he uttered a sudden groan, his head fell
back, and he became unconscious once more.</p>

<p>In this state he was taken home.</p>

<p>Under these considerations Vance saw that the responsibility
of notifying the police rested on him.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he visited headquarters and interviewed
the chief of police.</p>

<p>Detectives were at once furnished with an accurate description
of Edgar Vyce and despatched to hunt him up
and arrest him.</p>

<p>Vance then visited the offices of Jarboe, Willicutt &amp; Co.,
in the Board of Trade building, and explained the situation.</p>

<p>Mr. Jarboe, the head of the firm, was very much concerned
over the news.</p>

<p>“The affair will be printed in all the afternoon papers
and will certainly have a bad effect on the market. With
Mr. Whitemore down and out the Jarrett, Palmer &amp; Carrington
crowd will have a clean sweep. In which case
Mr. Whitemore’s losses will be immense. It is very bad,
very bad indeed,” said Mr. Jarboe, shaking his head
dismally.</p>

<p>“I have authority to act for Mr. Whitemore,” said
Vance, producing the paper which had been signed by the
stricken corn operator.</p>

<p>“That’s all right as far as it goes,” said Mr. Jarboe.
“It gives you the right to act for Mr. Whitemore, but
what can you do without money, even supposing you to
be capable of intelligent action on the big interests involved?”</p>

<p>“You are right, Mr. Jarboe; I’m afraid my hands are
tied. Mr. Whitemore intended to transfer his Chicago
National balance to me by check, but he lapsed into insensibility
at the critical moment.”</p>

<p>“Is that really the fact?” asked the senior partner, looking
his astonishment.</p>

<p>“Mr. George Bradley was present when Mr. Whitemore
asked for his check-book and expressed his intention.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the broker, “such a mark of confidence in
your honesty and business capacity is remarkable. It is
true I have lately heard him speak about you in terms of
the greatest praise, but—however, it is useless to discuss
the matter. He was prevented from signing the check,
you say, so you cannot touch a cent of Mr. Whitemore’s
money, even if your handling of that money would save
him from ruin.”</p>

<p>“True,” admitted Vance dejectedly.</p>

<p>“I will have to consult with my partners as to what is
best to be done under the circumstances,” said Mr. Jarboe,
“and will advise you as soon as possible. We recognize
your authority in the premises, and of course can make
no move unless authorized by you in writing.”</p>

<p>“The bear pool will certainly try to break the market,”
said Vance.</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly. Corn is high, and, but for this unfortunate
affair, likely to go higher. Mr. Whitemore’s holdings
have dominated the market and controlled the price.
He has stood ready to buy every bushel offered. Probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
half the visible supply of corn stored in the Kansas and
Nebraska elevators is owned by him—a fact you should be
familiar with, as you have just been out in that part of
the county in his interest. Jarrett, Palmer &amp; Carrington
most likely have a quantity of grain which they have
been holding back for a coup. Mr. Whitemore has suspected
its existence, but has failed to discover any evidence
to prove the fact. All reports point to the contrary
supposition.”</p>

<p>“I have thrown a little light on that point, Mr. Jarboe,”
said Vance.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Whitemore directed me to investigate the true
state of the corn situation at Elevatorville, Missouri.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“There are five elevators in that place. They have been
reported out of business temporarily.”</p>

<p>“So I understand. Are they not?”</p>

<p>“Possibly they may be,” replied Vance, “but all the same
Jarrett, Palmer &amp; Carrington have five million bushels
of corn stored in them at this moment.”</p>

<p>“Five million bushels?” almost gasped Mr. Jarboe.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—five million bushels.”</p>

<p>“If this is the fact,” said Mr. Jarboe, greatly excited,
“we are beaten to a standstill. Without money we cannot
take a dollar of that corn which the pool will throw on
the market at once, now they have learned of Mr. Whitemore’s
misfortune. Thornton, as sure as you sit there,
there will be a panic in the corn pit to-morrow morning.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE.</p>

<p>Vance returned to the Rookery Building in a very depressed
state of mind.</p>

<p>His interview with Mr. Jarboe seemed to indicate that
nothing short of absolute ruin now faced his employer—the
old man who at that moment lay at his home almost
at the point of death.</p>

<p>The afternoon papers contained an account of Mr. Whitemore’s
misfortune, and hinted at its probable bearing on
the next day’s corn market.</p>

<p>Several reporters were waiting to interview Vance on
his return.</p>

<p>To these gentlemen he was courteous but extremely reticent.</p>

<p>He insisted that the published reports were grossly exaggerated,
and put as bright a complexion on the situation
as he could.</p>

<p>But he was up against the fact that other reporters had
visited Mr. Whitemore’s residence and had learned that
his condition was critical.</p>

<p>“Poor Mr. Whitemore,” said Bessie, with tears in her
eyes, “it is awful to think he may never recover from that
cruel blow.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it will be as well he does not,” said Vance
gloomily.</p>

<p>“Why, Vance!” exclaimed Bessie in unfeigned surprise.
“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean, Bessie, that his absence from the office at this
time spells ruin in capital letters.”</p>

<p>“But he has put you in charge of everything,” said
Bessie, whose confidence in Vance’s abilities was supreme.</p>

<p>“But I can’t do a thing without money. I should need
a great deal of money.”</p>

<p>“He intended to sign a check for you,” she said,
“but——”</p>

<p>“Exactly, but he was unable to do it.”</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t I go to his house,” she said suddenly.
“He may have recovered his senses. Give me the check-book.
If the thing is possible I will get his signature and
bring it back to you.”</p>

<p>“Bessie, you’re an angel!” cried Vance, his face lighting
up with a new hope. “What a chump I am not to have
thought of that! The fact of the matter is, Mr. Jarboe’s
view of the situation knocked me endwise. I ought to
go myself instead of sending you, but I have lots to do
here, and I guess you’ll do as well.”</p>

<p>So Bessie took the check-book and started for Michigan
avenue, on the South Side.</p>

<p>While she was absent Vance brought all of his employer’s
documents relating to corn matters from the safe to
the inner office, and sat down to study them in connection
with printed reports and other sources of information he
found on Mr. Whitemore’s desk.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark when Bessie returned.</p>

<p>Vance saw at once from her face that she had failed
in her mission.</p>

<p>“You did not get his signature?” he said anxiously.</p>

<p>She shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>“It is feared by his physicians that Mr. Whitemore may
die before morning,” she said. “He has not recovered
consciousness at any time since he was taken home. I
left the check-book, after explaining matters to Mrs. Whitemore,
and she said if he regains his senses she will try
to get her husband to sign.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Bessie,” replied Vance gratefully. “You
have done all that I could have done myself under the
circumstances. I have been studying the situation, and
feel confident if I had enough money I could save Mr.
Whitemore. Unless I get it before business opens on the
Board of Trade in the morning I fear it will be too late.”</p>

<p>There was a painful silence for some moments.</p>

<p>“I am glad you have returned, Vance,” said Bessie at
length. “I don’t know what I should have done under
these conditions had you still been away. I think I should
have gone home at once and stayed there.”</p>

<p>“It would have been harder for you, I suppose. I hope
we shall always be such good friends, Bessie,” said the
boy earnestly.</p>

<p>“I’m sure there is no reason why we should not be,” she
replied. “Now you must tell me where you have been,
unless, of course, it’s a business secret.”</p>

<p>“I have been West on important business for Mr. Whitemore.
As soon as I get the chance I will tell you a good
many interesting particulars of my trip. It is time now
that you went home for the day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>“Why, how did you get that scar on your forehead?”
she asked, laying her fingers gently on a small abrasion
of the skin.</p>

<p>“That,” he replied, with a little laugh; “oh, I got that
down in Missouri yesterday morning while butting in
against a runaway team. I saved a man’s life and made
a good friend. His name is William Bradhurst, and he’s
a millionaire eleven times over. He—why, by George!”</p>

<p>Vance stopped and stared at the girl.</p>

<p>“Eleven millions!” he muttered. “Eleven millions in
cash and securities, that’s what he said.”</p>

<p>“Vance, what are you talking about?” asked Bessie
nervously.</p>

<p>“Eleven million dollars! Why, Great Caesar! If I
could induce him to back me up, with Mr. Whitemore’s
enormous corn holdings I should win out. Mr. Whitemore
would be saved financially, while Bradhurst himself
would almost double his capital, for if we cornered the
market—and with the start the boss has made we ought
to be able to do it—we could surely control the price. We
could easily buy up every bushel of that five million at
Elevatorville. That would keep that lot from being moved
to Chicago until we chose to have it put in motion. With
scarcely any corn in transport the market would soar to—good
gracious, I dare not think of it. I haven’t a moment
to lose. I must see Mr. Bradhurst at once.”</p>

<p>And Vance, for the first time in his life utterly ignoring
Bessie, rushed for his hat.</p>

<p>“Vance—Vance!” she cried, running after him. “You
haven’t gone crazy, have you?”</p>

<p>“Crazy!” he cried almost fiercely, turning full upon her.
“Yes, I have! I’m crazy—crazy with a scheme that means
millions to us. Go home. I can’t see you to the car. I’ve
got to go to the Grand Pacific on business.”</p>

<p>“Vance!” and then Bessie broke down.</p>

<p>“Why, what are you crying about?” he said with an
abruptness unusual with him.</p>

<p>“Because (sob) you are so (sob) rough with me.”</p>

<p>He looked at her a moment without speaking, and then
seemed to realize how he had been acting.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Bessie, for making you cry; but I’ve
thought of a plan by which I hope to save Mr. Whitemore,
and perhaps corner the market as he had started out to
do. If I put it through—there, I’m so excited over the
bare idea you must excuse me saying anything more. Everything
depends on my finding Mr. Bradhurst at his hotel
to-night, so you see I mustn’t delay a moment. There, I
wouldn’t offend you for the world,” he continued, as he
led her out of the office and locked the door; and then,
as she turned her tear-stained face before him in mute
forgiveness, he quite forgot himself and actually kissed her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Vance!” she exclaimed, blushing violently.</p>

<p>It is possible the boy was somewhat astonished at his
own audacity, but, if the truth must be told, he was not
a bit repentant, and would have repeated the performance
if he had dared.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later Vance was in Bradhurst’s apartments
in the Grand Pacific Hotel, talking with a purpose
and earnestness which he had never before displayed in
his life.</p>

<p>Bradhurst had been looking about him for something in
the line of business that would engage his attention, for
the mere idea of spending his wealth simply to amuse
himself by leading a life of ease was extremely distasteful
to him.</p>

<p>He was a man of active habits and a busy brain, and the
boy’s plan, which Vance laid down with convincing
directness, appealed to his fancy.</p>

<p>“Come over to the office, Mr. Bradhurst, and I will show
you the documents and the proofs. I can there better
explain what has been done, what our position is to-night,
and what we shall be able to accomplish. I have been
studying Board of Trade methods ever since I entered Mr.
Whitemore’s office. With the grasp on the market I have
at this moment, through my employer’s holdings, I see my
way clear, with your backing to corner the product and
force the price to almost any figure within reason. In a
week the Jarrett, Palmer &amp; Carrington pool won’t have a
leg to stand on.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll go over with you, Vance. But before
we go we’re going to have dinner. You look as though
you needed a square meal.”</p>

<p>“I’ve scarcely had a bite all day,” admitted the boy;
“but I don’t feel hungry at that.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you’re all worked up over this matter
and the unfortunate affair at your office. Take a wash
and we’ll go down to the dining-room.”</p>

<p>The clock in Mr. Whitemore’s office struck the hour of
midnight when the conference between Vance and William
Bradhurst came to an end.</p>

<p>“If for no other reason than because I owe you a good
turn I’ll see you through this, my boy,” said the big man
cheerfully. “But in addition to that, I see the opportunity
for both of us to make a million or more easily.”</p>

<p>“You are risking the money, Mr. Bradhurst, and the
profits over and above the figure at which corn closed to-day
will rightfully be yours. I am satisfied to save Mr.
Whitemore’s interest as it now stands.”</p>

<p>“Vance Thornton, I am backing your information and
experience with my money. It is a fair partnership. If
we win out the profits are to be evenly divided, do you
understand? Only on that condition will I go in.”</p>

<p>“But,” almost gasped the boy, “the profits may run
into——”</p>

<p>“Millions. Exactly. In which case you will be a millionaire
at eighteen. Do you object?”</p>

<p>The boy was too much stunned at the prospect to reply.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">WHO HOLDS THE ACE?</p>

<p>Rats, they say, will leave a sinking ship.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would hardly be fair to compare the solid
brokerage firm of Jarboe, Willicutt &amp; Co. with the rodents
in question, but Tennyson Jarboe, after his interview with
Vance Thornton and a careful study of Mr. Whitemore’s
condition from the latest reports in the evening papers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
decided, in consultation with his partners, that Jared
Whitemore was as good as done for, both physically and
financially.</p>

<p>With five million bushels of corn ready to be shipped
to Chicago at their nod, it was reasonable to expect that
the Jarrett, Palmer &amp; Carrington clique would jump into
the pit the next morning and, with little opposition to
fear, hammer the market to pieces.</p>

<p>In the ensuing panic corn would tumble like the famous
Humpty Dumpty of fairy fiction, and it therefore behooved
Jarboe, Willicutt &amp; Co., with the pointer they had
got from Vance, to sell a million or so bushels short for
their own private account.</p>

<p>It would be perfectly fair, since Mr. Whitemore’s boyish
representative could do nothing toward stemming the
current without money.</p>

<p>So when Vance Thornton reached Mr. Whitemore’s office
on the following morning he found a letter addressed to
himself and signed by Mr. Jarboe, in which that gentleman
expressed his regret that the firm saw no way of saving
their old customer from the expected crash unless something
tangible in the way of money was forthcoming, and
as this seemed to be out of the question, Jarboe,
Willicutt &amp; Co. could hardly be expected to execute any
further commissions for Mr. Whitemore.</p>

<p>“All right,” exclaimed Vance, coolly; “you have deserted
the ship just a moment too soon for your own good, Mr.
Jarboe. I’m only a boy, it is true, but I’m not taking off
my hat to you after that.”</p>

<p>Thrusting the letter in his pocket, he put on his hat
again.</p>

<p>“I’ll be back in half an hour,” he said to Bessie.</p>

<p>He rushed over to the Grand Pacific and sent his card
up to William Bradhurst.</p>

<p>“Read that,” he said to his new friend, handing him
Mr. Jarboe’s letter.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradhurst had finished breakfast, and was preparing
to go over to Mr. Whitemore’s office according to arrangements
entered into the night before.</p>

<p>“Cool, I must say,” he remarked, as he handed it back.
“Well, what are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Get another broker,” replied Vance decidedly.</p>

<p>“Quite right. Have you selected one yet?”</p>

<p>“I have a firm in my eye. It’s young, but I know them
both. They’re square as a die. This deal will be the making
of them, and I’m glad to put it in their way. Come,
let us go over to their office. We haven’t any time to lose
to-day.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bradhurst and Vance went to a brokerage office on
La Salle street.</p>

<p>It was on the third floor front, and the sign on the door
read Fox &amp; Mason.</p>

<p>“Hello, Thornton,” was Mr. Fox’s greeting as the boy
entered his private office with his friend. “Glad to see
you. Where’ve you been for the last two weeks, and may
I ask how your employer, Mr. Whitemore, is this morning?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been out of town. As to Mr. Whitemore, the latest
reports are not encouraging. Allow me to introduce you
to Mr. William Bradhurst.”</p>

<p>“Glad to know you, Mr. Bradhurst,” said Fox, genially.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Fox, I wish your earnest attention. I’m
going to put a good thing in your way,” said the boy in a
business-like tone.</p>

<p>“Thanks. All favors thankfully accepted,” and he
looked at Mr. Bradhurst as if he judged he was the good
thing suggested.</p>

<p>“Read this,” said Vance, and he handed him the paper
which authorized him to act for Mr. Whitemore.</p>

<p>Mr. Fox read it with some surprise.</p>

<p>“Now read this,” and Vance produced Mr. Jarboe’s
letter.</p>

<p>“Phew!” was the broker’s comment after he had perused
it.</p>

<p>“Under those circumstances I have decided to employ
new brokers. I have selected Fox &amp; Mason. Mr. Jarboe
has made a slight miscalculation. Instead of having no
money, I have a backing representing $11,000,000.”</p>

<p>“What’s that? Say that again, please!” ejaculated Fox
in amazement.</p>

<p>Vance repeated the amount.</p>

<p>“Say, you’re not joking, are you?” said Fox with a
smile.</p>

<p>“Never more serious in my life,” replied the boy earnestly.
“This gentleman, William Bradhurst, is worth exactly
that sum, and he is backing me. He is ready to give
you a check on the Bankers’ National Bank now to cover
my first transaction, which is an order to purchase any
part of five million bushels of corn as soon as it is offered
in the pit this morning.”</p>

<p>“Five million bushels!” exclaimed Fox, staring hard
at Vance.</p>

<p>“That’s what I said. Please call up the Bankers’ National
on your ’phone and verify my statement. Don’t lose
a minute, please.”</p>

<p>Jack Fox, still somewhat bewildered by such an order,
did as Vance requested him, and returned to his desk perfectly
satisfied with the result.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll get down to business,” he said.</p>

<p>And they did.</p>

<p>“After the close of the board to-day come to Mr. Whitemore’s
office, and you will find Mr. Bradhurst and myself
on deck. I will then go over certain plans I have in view
and make clearer our future business relations.”</p>

<p>Vance and his friend then left, while Fox, after leaving
a note for his partner, seized his hat and made straight for
the Board of Trade.</p>

<p>It was twenty minutes past nine when Vance’s broker
entered the board room.</p>

<p>The gong which started business would sound in ten
minutes, and already the floor was filling up, while groups
in earnest consultation were to be seen on the steps of both
the wheat and corn pits.</p>

<p>Sid Carrington and Abe Palmer were standing aloof on
the steps of the latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>A triumphant smile played about the mouths of each
of these bear operators.</p>

<p>For weeks they had been laying their plans, joining together
subtle schemes for the overthrow of Jared Whitemore,
but they had made but little way against the acute
old fox, who had been gradually drawing together his control
of the corn market.</p>

<p>Now the one man they had feared—the man who stood
like a stone wall between them and the accomplishment
of all their carefully conceived plans—had been suddenly
put out of the fight.</p>

<p>Their chance had come at last, and they did not intend
to do a thing with the corn market that morning.</p>

<p>Everybody interested was talking about the sudden
misfortune which had occurred to Jared Whitemore, and
not one but felt sure that one of the biggest slumps in
the history of the board was about to set in.</p>

<p>Consequently there was a subdued feeling of excitement
in the air.</p>

<p>Brokers with their pockets crammed with selling orders
constantly came on the floor, adding to the din.</p>

<p>Eyes were cast frequently and nervously at the clock,
noting the slow crawling of the minute hand toward the
half-hour mark.</p>

<p>Representatives from Jarboe, Willicutt &amp; Co. were ready
to sell the minute the gong opened proceedings.</p>

<p>Apparently all bulls had sought cover on this fateful
morning.</p>

<p>From the Western Union desks, located in a great railed-in
space in the northwest angle of the floor, came an incessant
ticking of the telegraph sounders, and messenger
boys pushed their way hither and thither across the floor
with yellow envelopes in their hands.</p>

<p>From the telephone alcoves sounded the almost continuous
ringing of the call bells.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with startling distinctness, came the single
stroke of a great gong.</p>

<p>Instantly, with a strident roar, the battle was on.</p>

<p>Corn in lots of five thousand was offered at once at half
a point below the previous day’s figures.</p>

<p>Not at first by Carrington and Palmer—they were holding
back, like men whose positions were unassailable.</p>

<p>The attack on corn was begun by the smaller fry, from
the outposts, as it were, of the bear army.</p>

<p>Carrington and Palmer were holding their immense
forces in reserve for the real attack that was to carry everything
down before the onslaught.</p>

<p>But the first real surprise developed at once.</p>

<p>Jack Fox, one of the new traders on the board, accepted
every bid offered.</p>

<p>He was immediately the center of a furious vortex that
hurled corn in a flood at his head.</p>

<p>But with a confident smile on his face, that soon began
to be noted with some uneasiness by cautious brokers, he
welcomed the rush with open arms.</p>

<p>The result was that the grain began to recover and
present a bold front to the bears.</p>

<p>“What in thunder does this mean?” growled Abe Palmer
to his partner.</p>

<p>“Some fool has lost his head, that’s all,” sneered Carrington.</p>

<p>“We’d better get in and send him where he belongs—to
the asylum,” said Palmer with a menacing toss of the
head.</p>

<p>Then Palmer and Carrington took a hand, and the excitement
grew to fever heat.</p>

<p>In spite of it all, Jack Fox, calm and serene amid the
babel and confusion, stood firm, and welcomed all selling
orders as he would a much-loved relative.</p>

<p>Around and around the pit went the question: Who is
Fox buying for?</p>

<p>Nobody could guess.</p>

<p>Suddenly there dawned the suspicion that Jared Whitemore
was still in the fight.</p>

<p>It must be so.</p>

<p>Who else could be loading up in the face of such adverse
conditions?</p>

<p>But the most astonished of all men were Jarboe and
Willicutt as the telephone conveyed the astounding intelligence
to their offices.</p>

<p>Already their representatives had, according to orders,
sold a million bushels of grain they did not own, but hoped
to be able to get later on at a low rate. Jack Fox was the
buyer of this lot.</p>

<p>Some one had clearly come to Mr. Whitemore’s rescue.</p>

<p>It apparently was some one able to resist the great bear
clique.</p>

<p>He must have recovered in time to furnish Vance Thornton
with the sinews of war to carry on the fight until he
could get down himself.</p>

<p>If this was true, then Jarboe, Willicutt &amp; Co. had made
a big blunder.</p>

<p>Not only had they placed themselves in a bad light with
their old client, but they were liable to face a big loss,
since they knew only too well that if the Whitemore forces
were still back of the fight they stood a poor chance of
getting any corn when they wanted it.</p>

<p>So Jarboe hastened to try and square himself.</p>

<p>He made a personal call on Vance.</p>

<p>“I received your letter,” said the boy coldly when the
big broker had been admitted to Mr. Whitemore’s sanctum,
where Vance now ruled supreme. “The only thing for me
to do was to hire a new broker. I have done so. From
the looks of things,” he said, with a significant smile, “I
still hold a grip on the market in spite of the Jarrett,
Palmer &amp; Carrington clique.”</p>

<p>Bessie knocked at the door, then entered and laid a slip
on the desk before Vance.</p>

<p>“I have bought over three million bushels this morning,
and I am ready and anxious to take in every grain that
may be offered.”</p>

<p>“Great heavens, young man!” exclaimed Mr. Jarboe in
utter amazement, “where have you got the money from
to do this? Has Mr. Whitemore come to his senses and
signed his balances over to you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>“I am obliged to refuse you this information, Mr. Jarboe,
as you have ceased of your own accord to represent
me. All I can say is this: I am at the head of the deal
from this on. I control all of Mr. Whitemore’s holdings.
I mean to control the price as he has done. No corn will
be moved east that amounts to anything until I say the
word. If you think you can beat me, Mr. Jarboe, sell a
million short and see. Good-day.”</p>

<p class="h2sub">THE SCHEME THAT DIDN’T WORK.</p>

<p>It had been a day of surprise on the Board of Trade.</p>

<p>Instead of the price of corn going on the toboggan it
had closed a couple of points to the good when business
ceased for the day.</p>

<p>Everybody was talking about the new factor that had
entered the fight.</p>

<p>The newspapers were full of surmises and hints and
rumors.</p>

<p>There was no doubt whatever that Mr. Whitemore was
out of the running.</p>

<p>Every afternoon paper published an authentic bulletin
of his condition, which was given out by reputable physicians
as practically unchanged.</p>

<p>A clot of blood or a bone was pressing on his brain, and
the chances that he would ever recover were extremely
doubtful.</p>

<p>Reporters, however, began to nose out the fact that Vance
Thornton, as Mr. Whitemore’s representative, was the
power that had made itself felt that day, and from present
indications was likely to continue to dominate the market.</p>

<p>Already he had gathered in the greater part of the
clique’s five million bushels, which everybody now knew
were stored in the elevators of Elevatorville.</p>

<p>At this rate he would soon have absolute control of
corn.</p>

<p>But Jarrett, Palmer &amp; Carrington were not beaten yet,
by a long chalk.</p>

<p>All during the rest of the week corn was thrown at Jack
Fox and accepted.</p>

<p>Every effort was made by the clique to overwhelm the
young operator, but it failed.</p>

<p>The Sunday editions now hailed Vance Thornton as the
coming corn king.</p>

<p>His picture was printed on the first page, and a copious
account of his young life up to date was published in
double-leaded type to increase its importance.</p>

<p>Thereafter Mr. Whitemore’s office was filled day after
day with eager traders anxious to gain his ear.</p>

<p>Nobody paid any attention whatever to the personality
of William Bradhurst, who studiously kept himself in the
background and watched with the most profound interest
and admiration the working out of the gigantic deal by
his young friend.</p>

<p>“You’re a wonder, Vance,” he said to the boy one day
as the two were getting ready to go to dinner. “A born
speculator. Why, I haven’t seen you ruffled a bit since you
took hold of this thing.”</p>

<p>“Yet it takes every minute of my time,” replied Vance,
with a smile that covered the weariness inseparable from
the control of the tremendous forces latent in a line of fifty
million bushels of corn.</p>

<p>“Necessarily,” admitted the millionaire, “but, boy, you
are stronger, bigger and shrewder than the great bear
clique pitted against you. You’ve overtopped the whole
crowd—the biggest men of the Board of Trade. A few
days more will show the world that you are really the new
corn Monte Christo. A few days more and these bears
will wake up to the fact that the corn they have promised
to deliver before they had it in hand is not to be got,
except from you—and at the price you choose to impose.
Jarrett, Palmer, Carrington, and others, not to speak of
your dear friends, Jarboe, Willicutt &amp; Co., will have to pay
or go bankrupt.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious, Mr. Bradhurst! That can have only
one meaning.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. You will actually have cornered the product.”</p>

<p>“I can’t realize it,” said Vance, pressing his hand to his
head. “And yet that is the very point I have been aiming
for. I am in it now up to my neck—both of us are.
Were we beaten at this stage you would be absolutely
ruined. And yet I have never for a moment seen you
weaken when I called for million after million of your
money. Do you actually realize to what extent I have
involved you?”</p>

<p>“I do,” replied William Bradhurst coolly. “But I entered
this affair on the principle of the whole hog or none.
To do otherwise was to invite disaster. No halfway measures
will answer in a deal of this kind. You must risk all
or better stay out.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. I fear that even Mr. Whitemore would
never have succeeded in doing what we have done. We
have half his capital at our back as it is.”</p>

<p>“By the way, how is Mr. Whitemore now?”</p>

<p>“I believe he will recover after all. He was taken to a
sanitarium a few days ago. He is a wreck at present, and
it will be some time before he recovers his grip again, if
he ever does.”</p>

<p>“And that rascally bookkeeper that struck him down has
not been arrested?”</p>

<p>“No. The police have not been able to locate his whereabouts.
He may have fled to Canada. Probably he is hiding
out in the wilderness somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Possibly; but you can’t tell. There are hiding places
in this city where, by the aid of confederates, he could
lie low in comparative safety. You know he was working
in the interests of the Jarrett, Palmer &amp; Carrington clique
at the start, and but for you taking hold his crime would
have proved of enormous advantage to them. Doesn’t it
strike you, then, that they haven’t deserted him—that his
immunity from arrest is largely due to their influence and
pull with their political friends?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think of that,” replied Vance thoughtfully.
“Your idea is reasonable, I am bound to admit.”</p>

<p>“Some day you may find I have hit the mark,” said
Bradhurst significantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>That the millionaire was correct in his deduction Vance
Thornton had reason to know ere many hours passed over
his head.</p>

<p>While Bessie’s admiration for Vance now increased
daily as she saw how he controlled the vast business enterprise
he had called into action, still, as he seemed to drift
farther and farther away from her—for he had little time
now to talk to her, except upon cold matters of business—her
gentle, loving heart grew sore and despondent within
her.</p>

<p>She felt that she had lost something that might never
again be hers.</p>

<p>And the reflection grieved her to the depths of her
nature.</p>

<p>Yet the morning and evening smile she daily bestowed
on him was just as bright, just as winsome as ever.</p>

<p>Her sorrow was her own.</p>

<p>It was not for Vance to suspect what was passing in
that true little heart.</p>

<p>Vance Thornton had returned from his lunch and was
shut up in his private office, as usual.</p>

<p>In the last thirty-six hours corn had advanced three cents
and the market was in a turmoil.</p>

<p>Bessie appeared at the door of the inner sanctum.</p>

<p>“There’s an old man out here who wants to see you on
business of importance. He wouldn’t give his name.”</p>

<p>“Very well; let him come in.”</p>

<p>It was a noticeable fact that the pretty stenographer did
not address the busy young operator as Vance any more;
and the boy was too much preoccupied these days to observe
the omission.</p>

<p>He was a curious character, the man who entered and
stood humbly bowing to the young Napoleon of La Salle
street, as many of the dailies called Vance in their scare-heads.</p>

<p>He was not exactly seedy, though he certainly was not
well dressed.</p>

<p>He was bent over, as if like Atlas he had been condemned
to carry the world on his shoulders, but had forgotten to
bring it along on this occasion.</p>

<p>But he had extremely bright eyes, which belied his other
marks of age, and they peered out in a restive manner
from under a pair of heavy, beetling brows.</p>

<p>“Take a seat, sir,” said Vance, pointing with his pen
to a chair. “How can I serve you? Make your errand
brief, for time with me is money.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to buy any corn?” asked the venerable
visitor in a shrill, squeaky voice.</p>

<p>“How much have you for sale?” asked the boy carelessly.</p>

<p>“Six million bushels.”</p>

<p>“What!” ejaculated Vance, wheeling about in his chair
and facing the old man.</p>

<p>“Six million bushels.”</p>

<p>“Is this a dream? I have no time for nonsense,” and
Vance wondered if he was not up against a lunatic or a
crank.</p>

<p>“You will find this no dream, but stern reality, Vance
Thornton,” said his visitor in a familiar voice, sitting
erect.</p>

<p>Tearing off his snow-white whiskers and pushing back
his old sunburned felt hat, he sat revealed as Edgar Vyce.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that the boy operator was thoroughly
astounded at the rascal’s audacity in thus venturing back
on the scene of his crime.</p>

<p>But he recovered his presence of mind in a moment.</p>

<p>His fingers moved to one of the electric buttons on the
end of his desk.</p>

<p>“Stop!” commanded Vyce, in a low, concentrated tone,
raising one hand which held a brown, cylinder-like missile.
“Move another inch and I’ll blow you and your desk into
La Salle street, and the wall with you.”</p>

<p>Vance instinctively paused.</p>

<p>“That’s right. I see you’ve got some common-sense,”
said Vyce grimly.</p>

<p>“What brought you here?” asked the boy, playing for
time.</p>

<p>“Business?”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“You observe this cylinder? It contains a small stick
of dynamite. If you do what I tell you it goes back into
my pocket; if you refuse—the newspapers will have a new
sensation, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“You seem to forget,” said Vance, coolly, “that dynamite
is like an overloaded shotgun—it works at both ends.
If you drop that thing in this room there isn’t a ghost of
a chance for you to escape yourself.”</p>

<p>“That needn’t worry you,” retorted the rascal angrily.</p>

<p>“What do you want of me, anyway?” asked the boy impatiently.</p>

<p>“I want you to sign that paper.”</p>

<p>He pushed a document to Vance.</p>

<p>It was a delivery slip for six million bushels of corn,
made out in favor of Sidney Carrington.</p>

<p>“So that’s your game, is it?” said Vance Thornton
slowly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; that’s my game.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged, Mr. Vyce. You’ve shown me the men
who are at your back.”</p>

<p>“Precious little good that will do you. You’ve got to
sign that paper and swear to drop out of the market,
or——” and Edgar Vyce made a significant movement with
his arm.</p>

<p>“That’s your ultimatum, is it?”</p>

<p>“That’s what it is.”</p>

<p>“Very well; I’ll do neither.”</p>

<p>“Are you mad?” exclaimed Vyce, furiously, feeling that
the object of his visit was a failure.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” replied the boy calmly, though every fibre
of his body shook inwardly at the probable risk he was
facing. “But do you fancy I would put myself into the
power of any crank, not to say scoundrel like yourself,
that chose to call and threaten me into doing something
he wanted. Not on your life!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you can help yourself!” sneered Vyce,
eyeing him savagely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>“Look behind you and you will see.”</p>

<p>Vance’s tone and manner threw the villain off his guard
an instant.</p>

<p>He started up in his chair and looked around, as though
he expected some one stood behind him.</p>

<p>Before he realized the trap that had been sprung on
him Vance had seized and wrenched the cylinder of pressed
dynamite from his hand.</p>

<p>“Now, Edgar Vyce, you’re my prisoner.”</p>

<p>He drew a small revolver from his pocket and covered
the scoundrel.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later Edgar Vyce was in the hands of
the Chicago police, and ultimately he was tried, convicted
and sent to the prison at Joliet for a long term.</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">WHAT SID CARRINGTON AND HIS PARTNER THOUGHT OF THE
CORN SITUATION.</p>

<p>That same afternoon Abe Palmer and Sid Carrington
were closeted together in their private office on La Salle
street.</p>

<p>Business on the Board of Trade was over for the day.</p>

<p>The former held a copy of an afternoon paper in his
hand.</p>

<p>“That bluff didn’t work, I see, and Edgar Vyce is in
jail,” he said gloomily.</p>

<p>“I see he is. I took him for a cleverer man than that,”
replied Carrington, with a muttered curse. “However,
we’ve got to get him clear somehow, or he’s liable to blab,
which would never do at all.”</p>

<p>“I should say not. It would simply ruin us.”</p>

<p>“It would for a fact. We would have to get out of
business here for good and all. I’ll see the leader of my
district to-night.”</p>

<p>“It looks as though we’ll have to throw up our hands,
anyway, Sid,” said Palmer, with a moody glance at the
decorated ceiling.</p>

<p>“Throw up nothing!” growled Carrington, with an impatient
wave of his right hand, on the little finger of which
glowed a valuable ruby ring.</p>

<p>“It’s easy to say that,” returned Abe, “but I don’t see
any chance of a turn. The pool is six million bushels
short, and the market remains as stiff as a poker.”</p>

<p>“Suppose it is. How can we tell but that this infernal
young monkey, Vance Thornton, may be at the end of his
tether also? It has taken an enormous amount of money
for him to swing this deal. What I want to know is where
did he get it?”</p>

<p>“That is what has bothered us right along. With all
our sagacity and our pet spy system we have not been able
to find out.”</p>

<p>“No, we haven’t. Who would ever have supposed that
boy would turn out such a hard proposition?”</p>

<p>“He’s a smart kid. He can’t be more than eighteen.
Why, it’s my opinion he could give old Whitemore points
in the business, as foxy as that old codger was.”</p>

<p>“It goes against my grain to give in to that boy,” said
Carrington bitterly.</p>

<p>“Well, if you can see any way out of it I’ll be glad to
hear of it. The fact remains that it has become exceedingly
difficult lately to get corn at all. Nobody seems to
be selling. Why, to-day even the bulls were bidding against
one another, with no sales under a full point advance.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” admitted the elegantly dressed Sid.</p>

<p>“When we sell the price will go down a bit, but the
moment we try to recover there seems to be no corn for
sale, and the market rebounds like a rubber ball.”</p>

<p>“It certainly is rotten,” replied Carrington, in a disgusted
tone.</p>

<p>“There’s only one thing I see to do,” said Abe Palmer,
in a confidential whisper.</p>

<p>“And that is?” asked Sid, eyeing him closely.</p>

<p>“To get out ourselves the easiest way we can and let
the ring go to smash.”</p>

<p>“Which means at the least calculation a loss of about
half a million apiece, not to speak of going back on the
bunch. If they should find out they’d never forgive us.”</p>

<p>“We’re not going to tell ’em. At any rate, if we’re going
to save anything from the wreck it’ll have to be every man
for himself; do you understand?”</p>

<p>“All right, Abe. I daresay you’re right. That boy
seems to have got us at last where the shoe pinches. But
I hate to give up the fight.”</p>

<p>“So do I; but if we hold on much longer we won’t be
able to get out at all, except on Thornton’s own terms—and
what they will be the Lord only knows. I don’t believe
he has any great love for either of us, especially you, since
I understand he got on to the true inwardness of the Kansas
City job you put up on him.”</p>

<p>“If I’d only dreamed of what was coming I’d have
pickled him for keeps that time,” said Sid, smiting the arm
of his chair savagely.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t have killed him, Sid?” the other said,
aghast.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I’m no murderer. But there are ways of
putting a chap out of the way for a time that answer quite
as well.”</p>

<p>So it was arranged between these two gentlemen before
they went home for the day that they should quietly begin
to cover their own personal sales—their share of the six
million bushels sold by the ring—without any reference
to the obligations they owed their partners in distress.</p>

<p>Jarboe, Willicutt &amp; Co., however, still hung on, hoping
for a turn in the market at any moment.</p>

<p>Long ago they had clearly seen that it was not Jared
Whitemore who was backing Vance Thornton.</p>

<p>As day by day Jack Fox, Vance’s known representative,
settled promptly for the corn he had bought, they wondered
how long his resources would hold out.</p>

<p>Certainly there was a limit to everything in this world,
and when Vance reached his, why then—at that stage of his
reflections Mr. Jarboe always smiled grimly.</p>

<p>But as day succeeded day, that desirable point never
seemed to be reached.</p>

<p>Thornton met all his engagements to the minute, and
Jack Fox continued to wear the same confident smile he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
had sported the morning he first went into the pit to buck
against the bear traders.</p>

<p>The same thorn annoyed Mr. Jarboe that bothered the
rest of the combination.</p>

<p>Where did Vance’s money come from?</p>

<p>For good and sufficient reasons, insisted on by Thornton
after the first week of their partnership, William Bradhurst
had kept discreetly in the background, meeting Vance
only when necessary, and then each time at a different
rendezvous.</p>

<p>No one who saw Bradhurst lounging at times about the
office door of the Grand Pacific Hotel would have suspected
that impenetrable man had a dollar at stake in any precarious
scheme.</p>

<p>Yet there were moments when he had reason to fear
that even his eleven millions, now almost swallowed up in
the insatiable maw of the corn market, would not be
enough to stave off ultimate disaster.</p>

<p>But never for a moment did he lose confidence in the
boy who was making such a shrewd fight against the combined
bear interests of the Board of Trade.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradhurst had come to be a frequent visitor at the
Thornton home, where he had been introduced by Vance
the evening following their partnership arrangement.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thornton and Elsie received him with all the
courtesy that well-bred people are wont to extend to a warm
personal friend of the son of the family.</p>

<p>To a man who for eight years had been debarred from
the ideals of civilization the pleasant home picture was
restful and refreshing.</p>

<p>Possibly the lovely personality of Elsie Thornton had
much to do with it.</p>

<p>At any rate, he found it agreeable to go there often.</p>

<p>“We see so little of Vance now,” Elsie said to him one
evening as they sat together in the pleasant sitting-room.
“You can scarcely imagine how much mother and I miss
him,” and a tear-drop glistened in her eye.</p>

<p>“I presume you hold me largely responsible for this
change in your domestic circle,” said Bradhurst, with almost
a feeling of remorse.</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Bradhurst, we do not hold you responsible,”
she answered, favoring him with such a bright glance that
his blood quickened in his veins.</p>

<p>“And yet, by backing him in this enterprise I have actually
kept him away from all the comforts of his home.”</p>

<p>“We do not look at it in that way. Rather we are grateful
to you for what you have done and are still doing
for Vance.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to see that you do not regard me as an undesirable
factor in the case,” said the millionaire in a tone
of pleasure.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” she answered softly. “With his growing
responsibilities Vance seems to have ceased to be a boy
any longer. Not that we regret the change, but it would
have pleased us better if the change had been more
gradual.”</p>

<p>“I can understand your feelings,” said Bradhurst sympathetically.
“But the end is almost in sight, Miss Elsie.
It seems to be only a question of a few days now when
Vance’s control of the corn market will be so complete
that the whole country will recognize it.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it wonderful to think what he has accomplished?”
cried Elsie, enthusiastically. “Why every day the papers
have something to say about him. This morning the
Record referred to him as the ‘young corn king.’ Think
of that!”</p>

<p>“And so he will be, I daresay, inside of forty-eight
hours. Your brother has a wonderful head for speculative
ventures. For that reason, and because I owe my life to
his pluck and presence of mind, I decided to see him
through, if it took the last dollar I possessed.”</p>

<p>“You were very good—very generous! We can never
thank you enough for the interest you have taken in
Vance.”</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t let the matter worry you any, Miss
Elsie,” said Bradhurst, with a glance of unfeigned admiration
for the girl.</p>

<p>She noticed the look and dropped her gaze to the carpet.</p>

<p>From that moment an increasing sympathy grew between
the two.</p>

<p>Elsie recognized and was grateful for what Mr. Bradhurst
was doing for her brother, whom she dearly loved,
while the millionaire found a new pleasure in talking to
and encouraging the lovely girl for whom he was beginning
to feel a warm regard.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">A CORNER IN CORN.</p>

<p>It was a bright, sunny morning, thirty-six hours later,
that William Bradhurst came downstairs and purchased
the morning paper at the news-stand in the lobby of the
Grand Pacific.</p>

<p>He opened it and cast his eye rapidly over the first page.</p>

<p>A leading article arrested his attention.</p>

<p>It was headed “A Corner in Corn.”</p>

<p>“By George!” he exclaimed, with no little excitement.
“At last!”</p>

<p>On crowded La Salle street a few hours later everybody
was talking about it.</p>

<p>There could no longer be any doubt that Vance Thornton,
the Boy Corn King, had got hold of every bit of
corn there was;</p>

<p>That he had actually cornered the visible supply.</p>

<p>That a mere boy could do this was simply astounding.</p>

<p>That he actually had done so was not now denied.</p>

<p>The news, fully verified, had by this time been wired all
over America.</p>

<p>Vance Thornton’s name was that morning on every business
man’s lips from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from the
Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>Traders who must buy the grain to fulfil their contracts
now began to call at Mr. Whitemore’s office in the Rookery
Building.</p>

<p>They inquired deferentially for the boy who held the
market in his hand, and bowed to his mandate when he
dictated the price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>Among the brokers who dropped in that morning was
Mr. Jarboe, the dignified head of the firm of Jarboe, Willicutt
&amp; Co.</p>

<p>“I’ll see him,” said Vance when his name was handed in.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mr. Thornton,” said the trader, as politely
as his feelings would permit.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mr. Jarboe. What can I do for you?”</p>

<p>“The fact is, young man,” answered the broker, hesitatingly,
“we are short to you one million bushels at (here
he named a figure) a bushel. I want to know how much
it is going to cost us to get out of your corner.”</p>

<p>To get out those words was worse than if he had to
swallow a bitter pill.</p>

<p>Vance looked at him with a quizzical smile.</p>

<p>“It seems to me it would have been better for you if
you had stuck by the sinking ship, Mr. Jarboe. You see,
she was only waterlogged for the moment, and a golden
pump put her on an even keel again.”</p>

<p>“All men make mistakes,” responded Mr. Jarboe
abruptly. “What is the figure?”</p>

<p>“In consideration of your long connection with Mr.
Whitemore,” said Vance, “I’ll let you off easy,” and he
named a price.</p>

<p>“Vance Thornton,” said Mr. Jarboe, his dignity suddenly
melting away, “you have acted like a man. Allow me to
shake you by the hand and congratulate you on the wonderful
ability you have displayed in engineering so gigantic
a deal. I am proud to acknowledge your acquaintance,
and I may say the same for my partners. Instead of crowing
over a firm of solid old traders whom you have caught
in the toils, and squeezing us badly, as you have the power
to do, you have acted with the utmost fairness. Our loss
is considerable, it is true, but no more than we deserve
under the circumstances. The only favor I will ask of
you is that you will keep this a secret. It would be a blow
to Mr. Whitemore, who I understand is nearly recovered
from his trouble, and expects soon to be back among us,
if he should learn the true facts of the case.”</p>

<p>“It shall go no further, Mr. Jarboe,” Vance assured
him.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” and Mr. Jarboe took out his check-book
and signed a check covering the sum due to Vance.</p>

<p>Then, with a bow and another handshake, he left the
office.</p>

<p>It was closing-up time.</p>

<p>All the working force of the office had gone out but
Miss Brown, who was adjusting her hat preparatory to
her departure.</p>

<p>Vance appeared at his office door.</p>

<p>“Bessie,” he said, “I’d like to see you.”</p>

<p>She entered the private room, and stood before him in
readiness to take any order he wished to give her.</p>

<p>It was not the old Bessie, but the new one, who always
addressed Vance now as Mr. Thornton.</p>

<p>“Bessie,” said Vance, taking both her hands suddenly
in his, “aren’t you glad?”</p>

<p>She looked at him in surprise, and then her gaze dropped.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you glad it is all over?” he repeated eagerly,
in the old voice that seemed to come to her like an echo
from the dead past.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she answered, in a trembling tone.</p>

<p>“You don’t know?” he said, almost plaintively. “Don’t
you care?”</p>

<p>She half turned away from him, but Vance seized her
by the shoulders and swung her back again.</p>

<p>“It is true that I’m not the same old Vance in some
respects. I’m to-day the king of the corn market, and I’m
worth several millions—just how many I can’t say as yet.
I went into this thing because it was my duty to try and
save Mr. Whitemore’s interests. If I’ve done more than
that it was because once I took hold I couldn’t let go. I
had to stick to my post—sink or swim on the ultimate
result. Well, I’ve come out ahead. The papers call me
the Corn King, and they tell the truth. But Bessie,” and
tears came to his eyes as he spoke the words, “I’d give
every dollar of my winnings—every cent I have made in
this deal—to hear you call me Vance once more as you
used to do, to know that you still think of me as you once
did.”</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then the girl gradually lifted her
eyes to his face.</p>

<p>“Vance!” she said softly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before Mr. Whitemore returned to his office a well man
again he heard enough about that famous corner in corn
to feel assured that Vance Thornton was the smartest boy
who ever walked in shoe leather.</p>

<p>The full particulars of the deal he learned as soon as
he and Vance came together again, and the result was
that the sign on the office door was altered to Whitemore
&amp; Thornton, and nobody was surprised when they saw it.</p>

<p>That fall there was a quiet wedding at the Thornton
home, on which occasion Elsie Thornton became Mrs. William
Bradhurst, and Vance was the best man.</p>

<p>Bessie Brown was among those present, and the pronounced
attention she received and accepted with pleasure
from Vance Thornton seemed to augur well for another
wedding at no very distant day, when the sweet little
stenographer might be expected to make happy for life
the boy who had effected A CORNER IN CORN.</p>
